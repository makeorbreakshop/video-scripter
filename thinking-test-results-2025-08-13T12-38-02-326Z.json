          "typography": "Bold white 3D text 'PERFECT FIT' with strong drop shadow creates dimensional hierarchy. Text is large, clean, and positioned in upper portion for immediate readability. Sans-serif font conveys technical precision.",

        "step_2_baseline_differentiation": "This thumbnail breaks dramatically from channel norms by using a single, bold product demonstration rather than talking heads, text-heavy layouts, or complex manufacturing scenes. The clean, almost product-advertisement aesthetic contrasts sharply with typical technical/industrial imagery. The vibrant color palette is much more consumer-friendly than usual technical grays and blues.",
        "step_3_psychological_mechanism": "The thumbnail triggers the 'demonstration promise' - viewers can immediately visualize a concrete, actionable outcome (perfect fit tolerance) through the simple box metaphor.

This thumbnail is much simpler and focuses on one clear visual metaphor.\n\nStep 3: Psychological Mechanism  \nThe \"perfect fit\" concept is universally satisfying - it triggers our desire for precision, completion, and problem-solving. The visual metaphor immediately communicates the value proposition.\n\nStep 4: Pattern Formation\nThis seems to be about visual metaphor + universal satisfaction trigger + clear value proposition.",

This thumbnail is much more conceptual and metaphorical - using a simple box to represent the concept of \"perfect fit\" rather than showing actual 3D printing equipment or parts.\n\nStep 3: Psychological Mechanism  \nThis works because it takes an abstract technical concept (tolerance in 3D printing) and makes it concrete and relatable through a simple visual metaphor. Everyone understands what a \"perfect fit\" looks like with a box and lid. It also creates curiosity - what's inside? How does this relate to 3D printing?\n\nStep 4: Pattern Formulation\nThis seems to be about \"Metaphorical Simplification\" - taking complex technical concepts and representing them through simple, universally understood objects/scenarios.",
