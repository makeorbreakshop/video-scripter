# Unified Video Import Optimization Summary

## Changes Applied

### 1. Optimized `fetchVideoDetailsBatch` Method
- **Before**: Fetched video details one by one, resulting in 2 API calls per video (1 for video, 1 for channel)
- **After**: Batch fetches up to 50 videos per API call and batch fetches channel statistics
- **API Call Reduction**: From O(n*2) to O(n/50 + m/50) where n=videos, m=unique channels
- **Example**: 1000 videos = ~22 API calls instead of 2000 calls (98.9% reduction)

### 2. Added `fetchChannelStatsBatch` Helper Method
- Fetches statistics for up to 50 channels per API call
- Collects channel handles, thumbnails, and statistics in one request
- Caches channel data to avoid duplicate requests

### 3. Optimized `fetchVideosFromChannels` Method
- **Before**: Used playlist API with sequential processing
- **After**: Uses search API with parallel processing (3 channels concurrently)
- **Benefits**:
  - Date filtering at API level (reduces data transfer)
  - Better performance for large channels
  - Direct video type filtering
  - Controlled concurrency to avoid rate limits

### 4. Added `fetchChannelVideosOptimized` Helper Method
- Uses YouTube Search API instead of Playlist API
- Supports date filtering directly in API request
- Efficient pagination with early termination when limits reached

### 5. Added `filterOutShorts` Helper Method
- Batch checks video durations to filter out YouTube Shorts
- Only called when `excludeShorts` option is true
- Returns videos 60 seconds or longer

## Performance Improvements

1. **API Call Efficiency**:
   - Video details: 50x fewer calls
   - Channel stats: Deduplicated and batched
   - Total reduction: ~98% fewer API calls

2. **Processing Speed**:
   - Parallel channel processing (3x faster for multi-channel imports)
   - Batch operations reduce network latency
   - Early termination when limits reached

3. **Resource Usage**:
   - Lower API quota consumption
   - Reduced memory footprint (streaming results)
   - Better error handling per batch

## Key Features Maintained
- All existing functionality preserved
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Same data structure and output format
- Error handling and logging improved
