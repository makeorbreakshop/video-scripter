For this channel, many titles are straightforward (e.g., object or technique focus). A deviation that foregrounds failure taps into a powerful narrative arc (setup ‚Üí error ‚Üí fix) that increases CTR and retention: viewers click to identify the mistakes and stay to see the resolution. The case-study format is well-suited to this arc, and Adam‚Äôs credibility makes the vulnerability feel instructive rather than clickbait.
