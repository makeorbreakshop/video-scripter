        "reasoning": "This video leverages a numbered, negative framing (“Two Mistakes!”) applied to a familiar in-channel project (“Workbench Ruler Build”), signaling candor and a promised resolution. The combination of (1) specificity (“Two”), (2) admitted fault (“Mistakes”), and (3) reference to an existing, recognized build creates a strong curiosity hook and a clear narrative arc (problem → diagnosis → fix), which typically lifts CTR and mid-video retention. For Adam Savage’s audience, transparency around process and failure aligns with maker culture values, making the content feel both novel and useful (postmortem/teardown), while the case-study format deepens engagement by focusing on applied learning from a recent, salient project.",
