The three-way contrast creates immediate stakes and clear questions (Is homemade better than the priciest option? How big is the value gap?), increasing CTR. Featuring a mass-market staple (fish sandwich) broadens addressable interest via familiarity and seasonal curiosity, while 'Challenge' signals gamified stakes and outcome uncertainty, supporting retention. The format is repeatable across items (burgers, pizza, nuggets) and testable by comparing similarly structured titles to channel baselines. Weâ€™d expect multiple prior triadic price-comparison uploads to cluster above the channelâ€™s median TPS and similar patterns across peer channelsâ€™ titles, confirming the structureâ€”not the specific ingredientâ€”is the driver.","testableWith":["get_video_bundle","search_titles","perf_snapshot"],"expectedEvidence":3},"duration":17178}
