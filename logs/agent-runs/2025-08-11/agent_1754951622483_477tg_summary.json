This framing promises a post‚Äëmortem/what‚Äëwent‚Äëwrong narrative that maker audiences value for avoiding pitfalls, and it differentiates from the channel‚Äôs typical polished builds. The specificity (two mistakes) implies concise, digestible takeaways, improving perceived utility and sharability. This is testable by comparing TPS of videos with error‚Äëadmission/numbered mistake phrasing against otherwise similar build videos on the channel and in the maker niche.",
