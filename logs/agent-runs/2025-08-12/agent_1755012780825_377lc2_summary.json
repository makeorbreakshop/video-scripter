The focus on a ‚Äúnew artist‚Äù broadens relevance beyond niche theory content to the full music discourse, increasing click propensity. Rick Beato‚Äôs audience skews toward critical takes on modern production, so contrarian titles align with audience priors and recommendation graph, boosting initial CTR and subsequent session reach. We can test by comparing TPS of negative-judgment titles vs neutral/explanatory titles on the channel and seeing if negatives systematically outperform.",
