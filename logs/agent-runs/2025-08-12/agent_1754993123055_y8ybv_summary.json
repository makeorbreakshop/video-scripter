For Rick Beato‚Äôs audience, opinionated industry critiques tend to outperform technical explainers because they promise conflict, identity-relevant judgments, and conversational fuel‚Äîleading to higher CTR and early comment velocity, which the algorithm amplifies. This is testable by comparing the performance of Beato‚Äôs negative-opinion titles vs neutral/technical ones, and by checking similar titles across music commentary channels.",
