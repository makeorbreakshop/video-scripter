The #oddlysatisfying tag aligns the content with a well-established vertical that enjoys broad algorithmic demand and high replay propensity due to visually satisfying loops. Mechanical Triage‚Äôs niche likely overlaps with visually pleasing mechanical processes, so this framing improves audience‚Äìcontent match beyond the channel‚Äôs usual viewers, expanding distribution. Together, these factors plausibly increase early engagement velocity (CTR, replays), which is critical for Shorts ranking and can yield outsized TPS.",
