Targeting a ‘new artist’ broadens relevance beyond a single fanbase, reducing alienation and amplifying shareability. The conflict-centric framing invites comments and watch time via rebuttals/defenses, which can further boost distribution. If this hypothesis is correct, similar negative-opinion, first-person titles on this channel (and comparable music-commentary channels) should show higher CTR and TPS than baseline, with at least a medium effect size.",
