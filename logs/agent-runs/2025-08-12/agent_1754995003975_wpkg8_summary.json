For a channel focused on mechanical content, framing a clip as ‚Äòoddly satisfying‚Äô broadens reach beyond subscribers to a wider ASMR/satisfying niche, improving initial CTR and completion rates‚Äîtwo key drivers of Shorts velocity. The ‚ÄòOutlier‚Äô topic also suggests it deviates from the channel‚Äôs usual titling, increasing novelty and appeal to new viewers.",
