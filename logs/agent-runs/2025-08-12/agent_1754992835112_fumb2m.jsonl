The first-person apology (“I’m Sorry…”) plus ellipsis creates a curiosity gap, while negative valence (“sucks”) signals conflict, both known to increase clicks. This framing likely pulls in non-subscribers searching for the artist and boosts CTR; the controversy sustains watch time as viewers seek the justification. We can test by comparing performance of titles containing apology/negative terms (e.g., “I’m sorry”, “sucks”, “worst”, “hate”, “overrated”, “the problem with”, “ruined”) and “new artist/this artist” against channel baselines and inspecting CTR/retention.","testableWith":["get_video_bundle","search_titles","perf_snapshot"],"expectedEvidence":3},"duration":36100}
