Rick Beato’s audience expects music critique and industry takes, so a bold contrarian stance promises conflict and resolution in an explainer format, likely increasing average view duration via payoff-seeking. This mix typically outperforms neutral titles because it activates moral-emotional engagement (comments, watch time) and cross-topic curiosity from both fans and skeptics of the artist.",
