Together these cues likely lift thumbnail/title CTR and first 24‚Äì48h velocity, which is a known predictor of higher TPS. We can validate by comparing performance of Beato (and similar channels) videos that include negative sentiment keywords and apology/confession phrases versus his standard explainer titles, and check if those with ‚Äònew/this artist‚Äô recency cues systematically outperform baseline.","testableWith":["get_video_bundle","search_titles","perf_snapshot"],"expectedEvidence":3},"duration":20867}
