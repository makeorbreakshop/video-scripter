The ellipsis + apology frames a narrative (why he feels compelled to say this) and the blunt verdict (‚Äúcompletely sucks‚Äù) promises decisive judgment, reducing cognitive cost to click. The vagueness of ‚Äúnew artist‚Äù withholds the subject, maximizing curiosity. This combination is replicable (title formula, tone, framing) and should correlate with above‚Äëbaseline TPS within his catalog and across similar creator niches.",
