  "prompt": "You are a team of three specialized analysts examining this viral YouTube video and its thumbnail to extract transferable success patterns.\n\n**DESIGN ANALYST**: Focus on visual composition, color theory, typography, layout principles, and aesthetic appeal. Rate the design quality and identify specific design choices that impact performance.\n\n**PSYCHOLOGY ANALYST**: Focus on emotional triggers, cognitive biases, viewer psychology, curiosity gaps, and behavioral responses. Explain why viewers would click based on psychological principles.\n\n**MARKETING ANALYST**: Focus on positioning, competitive differentiation, target audience alignment, trend awareness, and market positioning. Compare to successful content in this niche.\n\nTARGET VIDEO (17.7x performance):\nTitle: \"How to Design a Print with Perfect Tolerance EVERY Time\"\nViews: 164,825\nChannel: Slant 3D\nNiche: Fashion & Beauty\nSummary: Designing parts with perfect tolerances for 3D printing by applying proven design principles that ensure a reliable fit regardless of printer, material, or slicer settings. Techniques include creating press-fits, snap-fits, and interlocking components while addressing issues like shrinkage and machine variations through features such as rounded corners and compliant designs.\n\nCHANNEL BASELINE (normal performers for comparison):\n1. \"Why Variation is Bad | Multipurpose Machines are a Bad Sign | 3D Printing News | Podcast Ep 115\" - 7,594 views (0.8x)\n2. \"How Parts are Made in a Giant 3D Print Farm\" - 9,863 views (0.9x)\n3. \"Should We Replace Etsy? | Limiting Tangled Orders | Rocket Engines | 3D Printing News Ep 110\" - 11,047 views (1.0x)\n4. \"How We Would Make a Product for Mr. Beast\" - 11,651 views (1.0x)\n\nEach analyst should contribute their expertise to identify what makes this video outperform the baseline.
