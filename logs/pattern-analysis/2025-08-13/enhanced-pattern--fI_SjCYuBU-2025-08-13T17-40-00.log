Dark background.\n\nImage 3: Shows \"DESIGN ANIMATE DONE\" text with a purple/blue circular design element and glowing effects.\n\nImage 4: Shows a person (Dansky) smiling in what appears to be a setup with purple lighting and shelving in background.\n\nImage 5: Shows a person (Dansky) in a red hoodie with what appears to be a website or portfolio design behind him.\n\nImage 6: Shows the Photoshop \"Ps\" logo and \"LIVE DESIGN IN PHOTOSHOP\" text with the person (Dansky) smiling.\n\nNow analyzing the content:\n- Breakthrough video: \"Design Like a Pro with 7 Must-Have Tools\" - This is a tutorial/educational format about specific tools\n- Baseline videos: Mostly \"Live\" design sessions, focusing on real-time workflows and processes\n\nThe breakthrough differentiates by:\n1. Visual: Clean, focused on the software icon vs. person-centric or text-heavy thumbnails\n2. Content: Structured tutorial format vs. live streaming/process videos\n3. Promise: Concrete tools/skills vs. watching a process unfold\n\nLet me structure this analysis properly.",
