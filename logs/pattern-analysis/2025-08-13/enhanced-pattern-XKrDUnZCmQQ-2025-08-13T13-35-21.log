  "prompt": "You are a YouTube performance analyst examining why one video dramatically outperformed a channel's baseline using systematic visual analysis.\n\nCONTEXT:\n- Channel: Slant 3D (Fashion & Beauty content)\n- Typical performance: 0.8x, 0.9x, 1.0x, 1.0x \n- Target breakthrough: 164,825 views (17.7x multiplier)\n- Audience: Content consumers in Fashion & Beauty niche\n\nTARGET VIDEO:\nTitle: \"How to Design a Print with Perfect Tolerance EVERY Time\"\nPerformance: 17.7x normal performance\nSummary: Designing parts with perfect tolerances for 3D printing by applying proven design principles that ensure a reliable fit regardless of printer, material, or slicer settings. Techniques include creating press-fits, snap-fits, and interlocking components while addressing issues like shrinkage and machine variations through features such as rounded corners and compliant designs.\n\nBASELINE COMPARISON (last 10 videos):\n1. \"Why Variation is Bad | Multipurpose Machines are a Bad Sign | 3D Printing News | Podcast Ep 115\" - 7,594 views (0.8x)\n2. \"How Parts are Made in a Giant 3D Print Farm\" - 9,863 views (0.9x)\n3. \"Should We Replace Etsy? | Limiting Tangled Orders | Rocket Engines | 3D Printing News Ep 110\" - 11,047 views (1.0x)\n4. \"How We Would Make a Product for Mr. Beast\" - 11,651 views (1.0x)\n\nSYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:\nUsing chain of thought reasoning, analyze the thumbnail step-by-step:\n\nStep 1: VISUAL INVENTORY\nExamine the thumbnail's color psychology, typography choices, composition elements, visual hierarchy, and emotional triggers systematically.\n\nStep 2: BASELINE DIFFERENTIATION  \nCompare against the channel's normal content patterns. What visual elements break from their typical format or style?\n\nStep 3: PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANISM\nExplain the specific psychological principle that makes viewers more likely to click this thumbnail over similar content.\n\nStep 4: PATTERN FORMULATION\nSynthesize findings into a replicable pattern with clear success factors.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n{\n  \"step_1_visual_inventory\": {\n    \"colors\": \"Primary colors and their psychological impact\",\n    \"typography\": \"Text style, size, placement analysis\", \n    \"composition\": \"Layout and visual hierarchy description\",\n    \"focal_points\": \"What draws the eye first, second, third\"\n  },\n  \"step_2_baseline_differentiation\": \"How this thumbnail breaks from channel norms\",\n  \"step_3_psychological_mechanism\": \"Why this specific combination triggers more clicks\",\n  \"step_4_pattern_formulation\": {\n    \"pattern_name\": \"Memorable 2-4 word pattern name\",\n    \"pattern_description\": \"One clear sentence explaining the core principle\",\n    \"success_factors\": [\"Factor 1\", \"Factor 2\", \"Factor 3\"],\n    \"replication_strategy\": \"How to apply this pattern to similar content\"\n  },\n  \"confidence_level\": \"High/Medium/Low with brief justification\",\n  \"channel_specific_insight\": \"Why this worked for THIS channel specifically\"\n}\n\nVERIFICATION CHECK:\nAfter analysis, confirm your visual observations are actually present in the thumbnail and align with established click-psychology principles."
