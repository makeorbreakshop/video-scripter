# Topic Modeling at Scale: Strategy for Millions of Videos

## Current Situation
- 177K videos → 216 topics
- Model trained on 30K sample
- Planning to add hundreds of thousands more videos
- Need strategy for millions of videos

## Challenges with Quarterly Full Retraining

### 1. Computational Complexity
- BERTopic clustering is O(n²) - becomes impossible at scale
- 1M videos = 1 trillion distance calculations
- 10M videos = 100 trillion calculations
- Even with sampling, reprocessing millions is expensive

### 2. Topic Stability Issues
- Topics shifting every quarter disrupts user experience
- Historical analytics become meaningless if topics change
- Content creators can't track performance consistently
- URLs/filters based on topics would break

### 3. Business Continuity
- Can't afford to reclassify millions of videos quarterly
- Database updates at that scale are risky
- Downtime and processing costs become prohibitive

## Recommended Approach: Hybrid Static + Dynamic System

### 1. Core Topic Taxonomy (Static Foundation)
```
Core Topics (rarely change):
- Technology & Reviews
- DIY & Crafts  
- Gaming & Entertainment
- Lifestyle & Living
- Business & Finance
- etc.

These become your permanent taxonomy - like YouTube's categories but more granular (200-500 topics)
```

### 2. Incremental Classification (Daily)
```python
# New videos get classified against existing topics
new_video_embedding = get_embedding(video)
topic_id, confidence = model.transform([new_video_embedding])

# Only add to database if confidence > threshold
if confidence > 0.3:
    assign_topic(video_id, topic_id)
else:
    mark_for_review(video_id)
```

### 3. Topic Evolution (Controlled)
Instead of full retraining, use these strategies:

#### A. Topic Splitting (When topics get too large)
```python
# If "Minecraft Gaming" has 500K videos, split into:
- "Minecraft Survival"
- "Minecraft Creative Building"  
- "Minecraft Modded"
- "Minecraft Tutorials"

# Keep parent topic for backward compatibility
```

#### B. New Topic Detection (Emerging trends)
```python
# Monitor outliers and low-confidence classifications
# When patterns emerge, create new topics:
- "AI Generated Content" (new in 2023)
- "YouTube Shorts Tutorials" (new format)
```

#### C. Topic Merging (Dying trends)
```python
# Merge small/inactive topics
# Keep mappings for historical data
"Fidget Spinner Tricks" → "Nostalgic Toy Reviews"
```

### 4. Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Establish Core Taxonomy (One-time)
1. Use current 216 topics as starting point
2. Manually review and organize into permanent hierarchy
3. Create topic guidelines and examples
4. Build topic classifier with high accuracy

#### Phase 2: Incremental System (Ongoing)
```python
# Daily process:
1. Classify new videos against existing topics
2. Track classification confidence
3. Flag outliers for review
4. Update topic centroids with new examples

# Monthly process:
1. Review outlier clusters
2. Identify emerging topics
3. Audit topic health (size, activity, accuracy)
4. Make controlled adjustments
```

#### Phase 3: Scaling Infrastructure
```python
# Use approximate methods at scale:
- Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for similarity
- Hierarchical classification (coarse → fine)
- Distributed processing with topic shards
- Caching and CDN for topic data
```

## Recommended Architecture for Scale

### 1. Tiered Classification
```
Level 1: Super Categories (15-20) - Very stable
Level 2: Main Categories (50-100) - Stable  
Level 3: Specific Topics (200-500) - Some evolution
Level 4: Micro-niches (1000+) - Dynamic, optional
```

### 2. Database Design
```sql
-- Core tables that rarely change
CREATE TABLE topic_taxonomy (
    topic_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    topic_name TEXT,
    parent_id INTEGER,
    level INTEGER,
    is_active BOOLEAN,
    created_date DATE
);

-- Mapping table for evolution
CREATE TABLE topic_evolution (
    old_topic_id INTEGER,
    new_topic_id INTEGER,
    migration_date DATE,
    migration_type TEXT -- 'split', 'merge', 'rename'
);

-- Video assignments
CREATE TABLE video_topics (
    video_id TEXT,
    topic_id INTEGER,
    confidence FLOAT,
    assigned_date DATE,
    model_version TEXT
);
```

### 3. Smart Sampling for Validation
```python
# Instead of retraining everything:
def quarterly_validation():
    # Sample 10K videos per topic
    # Check if still classified correctly
    # Calculate topic drift score
    # Only retrain specific topics if needed
```

## Migration Strategy from Current System

1. **Lock Current Topics** (Week 1)
   - Freeze the 216 topics as v1.0
   - Document each with keywords and examples
   - Create manual hierarchy if needed

2. **Build Incremental Classifier** (Week 2-3)
   - Use saved BERTopic model for new videos
   - Set confidence thresholds
   - Build outlier detection

3. **Historical Backfill** (Week 4+)
   - Classify remaining 147K videos
   - Store with model version
   - Keep old classifications for comparison

4. **Monitor and Evolve** (Ongoing)
   - Track topic health metrics
   - Review monthly reports
   - Make controlled adjustments

## Key Principles for Scale

1. **Stability Over Perfection**
   - Better to have consistent topics than perfectly optimized ones
   - Users need predictability

2. **Incremental Over Batch**
   - Process new content as it arrives
   - Avoid massive reprocessing jobs

3. **Evolution Over Revolution**
   - Topics should evolve, not restart
   - Maintain historical continuity

4. **Human-in-the-Loop**
   - Algorithmic detection, human validation
   - Domain experts review new topics

5. **Version Everything**
   - Track which model version classified each video
   - Enable rollback if needed

## Example: YouTube's Approach
YouTube has ~15 top-level categories that haven't changed in years:
- Music, Gaming, Sports, Entertainment, etc.

But they have thousands of "topics" detected algorithmically:
- These map to the stable categories
- Can emerge and disappear dynamically
- Don't break existing systems

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Formalize Current Topics**
   - Review all 216 topics
   - Create stable naming and hierarchy
   - Document with examples

2. **Build Incremental Pipeline**
   - Script to classify new videos daily
   - Confidence tracking system
   - Outlier detection

3. **Create Topic Dashboard**
   - Monitor topic health
   - Track emerging clusters
   - Review classification accuracy

4. **Plan for Evolution**
   - Define criteria for new topics
   - Process for splitting/merging
   - Version control strategy

This approach will scale to millions of videos while maintaining stability and allowing controlled evolution.
