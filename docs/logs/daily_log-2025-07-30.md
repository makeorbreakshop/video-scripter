## Session Timeline

- **Start Time**: Morning session
- **Session Focus**: LLM Summary Worker Optimization & IOPS Management

## Major Accomplishments

### [1] Speed-Optimized LLM Worker with IOPS Tracking

1. **Task**: Create speed-optimized version of LLM summary worker that maximizes throughput while staying under Supabase Micro plan's 500 IOPS limit

2. **Context**: Previous I/O-optimized version was too conservative. User wanted faster processing while respecting IOPS constraints

3. **Implementation**:
   - Created `/workers/llm-summary-worker-speed-optimized.js`
   - 250 videos per batch (larger batches = fewer DB operations)
   - 30 concurrent OpenAI requests (up from 10)
   - 3-second enforced batch intervals
   - Real-time IOPS tracking and display

4. **Key Features**:
   - **IOPS Monitoring**: Shows current, average, and total DB operations
   - **Batch Processing**: Single DB upsert per 250 videos
   - **Target Performance**: ~450 videos/minute with <1 IOPS/second
   - **Live Stats**: `IOPS: Current=0.67/sec | Average=0.65/sec | Limit=400/sec`

5. **Technical Details**:
   ```javascript
   // Track IOPS in real-time
   function trackIOPS(operations = 1) {
     const now = Date.now();
     totalDbOperations += operations;
     iopsHistory.push({ timestamp: now, operations });
     // Calculate rolling 60-second window
     const currentIOPS = totalOpsInWindow / windowDuration;
     return currentIOPS;
   }
   ```

### [2] Database Query Fixes & Optimizations

1. **Issue**: Worker encountered multiple errors:
   - Initial count query timeout
   - Database constraint violation (null channel_id)
   - Excessive filtering removing valid videos

2. **Solutions Applied**:
   - Added `channel_id NOT NULL` validation to queries
   - Created `batch_update_llm_summaries` SQL function for efficient updates
   - Removed unnecessary "Make or Break Shop" channel filtering
   - Fixed query to process ALL videos needing summaries

3. **SQL Function Created**:
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION batch_update_llm_summaries(updates jsonb)
   RETURNS void AS $$
   DECLARE
     update_record jsonb;
   BEGIN
     FOR update_record IN SELECT * FROM jsonb_array_elements(updates)
     LOOP
       UPDATE videos
       SET 
         llm_summary = update_record->>'llm_summary',
         llm_summary_generated_at = (update_record->>'llm_summary_generated_at')::timestamp
       WHERE id = update_record->>'id';
     END LOOP;
   END;
   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
   ```

4. **Result**: Worker now properly identifies 103,639+ videos needing summaries (increased from filtered subset)

### [3] Supabase Micro Plan IOPS Analysis

1. **Discovery**: Supabase Micro plan has 500 IOPS limit
   - User was hitting 2,800 IOPS (5.6x over limit)
   - Caused worker to stop processing

2. **Optimization Strategy**:
   - Batch size: 250 videos
   - Operations: 1 read + 1 write per batch = 2 IOPS
   - Interval: 3 seconds between batches
   - Result: ~0.67 IOPS/second (well under 500 limit)

3. **Performance Balance**:
   - Theoretical max: ~5,000 videos/minute
   - Actual (OpenAI limited): ~450 videos/minute
   - IOPS usage: <1 per second average

*Session Status: Created IOPS-optimized worker with real-time monitoring*

### [4] LLM Summary Integration in Unified Import

1. **Issue**: LLM summaries were generated but not uploaded to Pinecone in the unified import process

2. **Discovery**: 
   - Found TODO comment instead of actual implementation
   - Summary embeddings were generated but discarded
   - Separate worker was created to handle this retroactively

3. **Solution Implemented**:
   - Added `uploadSummaryEmbeddingsToPinecone()` method to unified import service
   - Uses same Pinecone index as titles but with `llm-summaries` namespace
   - Updates `llm_summary_embedding_synced` flag after successful upload
   - Integrated with existing parallel processing flow

4. **Technical Details**:
   ```typescript
   // Now part of unified import pipeline
   1. Generate LLM summaries (parallel with title/thumbnail embeddings)
   2. Generate summary embeddings (after summaries complete)
   3. Upload to Pinecone llm-summaries namespace
   4. Update sync status in database
   ```

5. **Documentation Updated**:
   - Added LLM summary section to processing pipeline docs
   - Updated database schema documentation
   - Added summary fields to technical documentation

*Session Status: Unified import now handles complete LLM summary pipeline*

### Performance Metrics

- **Concurrency**: 30 parallel OpenAI requests

### [5] Fixed LLM Summary Pinecone Sync Issue

1. **Issue**: Discovered that LLM summaries were being generated and uploaded to Pinecone, but the `llm_summary_embedding_synced` flag was not being updated in the database

2. **Investigation**:
   - Verified 24 videos had LLM summaries generated successfully
   - Found 22,800 vectors in Pinecone's llm-summaries namespace
   - But 0 videos marked as synced in database

3. **Root Cause**: Variable scope issue in `uploadSummaryEmbeddingsToPinecone()` method
   - `videoIds` was declared inside try block (line 678)
   - But used for database update outside that scope (line 721)
   - This caused a silent failure when updating sync status

4. **Fix Applied**:
   ```typescript
   // Before: videoIds declared inside try block
   try {
     const videoIds = successfulEmbeddings.map(e => e.videoId);
     // ... rest of code
   }
   
   // After: videoIds declared before try block
   const videoIds = successfulEmbeddings.map(e => e.videoId);
   try {
     // ... rest of code
   }
   ```

5. **Result**: Database sync status will now properly update after Pinecone upload

*Session Status: Fixed critical bug in unified import LLM summary pipeline*

   - **Performance Optimization**: Multi-level caching (results, channels, embeddings)

3. **Performance Improvements**:
   - **Caching**: 2-minute result cache, 10-minute channel cache, 30-minute embedding cache
   - **Optimized SQL**: Created `search_channels` function for faster channel queries
   - **Duplicate Fix**: Resolved React key warning with unique composite keys
   - **Optimistic UI**: Instant feedback when query changes significantly

4. **Technical Details**:

   channelCache: 10 minutes (100 entries max)
   embeddingCache: 30 minutes (200 entries max)
   
   // Smart intent detection
