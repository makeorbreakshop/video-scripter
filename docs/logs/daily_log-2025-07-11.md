## ðŸ§ª Today's Work (2025-07-11)

### [1] YouTube API Quota Tracking System Implementation
- **Background**: User requested tracking of YouTube API usage to monitor daily 10,000 unit quota and avoid rate limits before importing 10 channels worth of videos
- **Investigation**: Discovered discrepancy between expected and actual YouTube API usage - system uses search.list (100 units) instead of playlistItems.list (1 unit)
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive quota tracking system with database schema, service layer, API endpoints, and dashboard UI
- **Implementation**: Created complete tracking infrastructure with pre-flight quota checks and real-time monitoring

**Technical Details:**
- **Database Schema**: Created `youtube_quota_usage` and `youtube_quota_calls` tables with tracking functions
- **Service Layer**: Built `YouTubeQuotaTracker` class with API cost mapping and quota validation
- **API Integration**: Instrumented unified video import service with quota tracking on all YouTube API calls
- **Dashboard UI**: Created `/quota-dashboard` page with real-time usage visualization and recent call history
- **Worker Integration**: Added quota estimation and pre-flight checks to background worker system

**Quota Cost Structure:**
- **channels.list**: 1 unit
- **videos.list**: 1 unit  
- **playlistItems.list**: 1 unit
- **search.list**: 100 units (explains higher usage)

**Features Implemented:**
- Real-time quota status tracking with percentage usage
- Pre-flight quota availability checks before large imports
- Detailed API call logging with job ID tracking
- Color-coded dashboard alerts (green/yellow/red based on usage)
- Recent API call history with method, cost, and description
- Quota estimation for channel imports based on video count

**Impact:**
- Complete visibility into YouTube API usage patterns
- Prevention of quota exhaustion during large imports
- Understanding of actual vs expected API costs
- Foundation for quota-aware import scheduling

### [2] YouTube API Quota Optimization - Replaced search.list with playlistItems.list
- **Background**: Discovered system was using search.list (100 units/call) instead of playlistItems.list (1 unit/call)
- **Investigation**: Google Cloud Console showed 309 quota units used from 12 API calls for single channel import
- **Root Cause**: Unified import service was using expensive search API for "better performance" 
- **Solution**: Refactored to use uploads playlist approach as documented in channel-import-api-flow.md
- **Implementation**: 
  - Get channel's uploads playlist ID via channels.list (1 unit)
  - Use playlistItems.list to fetch videos (1 unit per 50 videos)
  - Added missing quota tracking for fetchVideoDetails method
- **Impact**: 97% reduction in quota usage (309 units â†’ 9 units for ~100 video channel)

### [3] Production Testing & Verification of Quota Optimization
- **Background**: Tested the optimized playlistItems.list implementation in production
- **Testing**: Successfully imported a channel using the new optimized code
- **Results**: 
  - Observed 5 channels.list + 2 playlistItems.list + 4 videos.list calls = ~11 units total
  - Confirmed 96% reduction from previous 309 units
  - All API calls properly tracked in quota system
- **Impact**: Can now import ~900 channels per day vs ~32 channels previously
- **Note**: Google Cloud Console quota counter has 1-2 hour delay for updates

### [4] SQL Ambiguity Fix
- **Issue**: Worker failed with "column reference 'quota_limit' is ambiguous" error
- **Root Cause**: Variable name conflicted with column name in check_quota_available function
- **Solution**: Renamed variable to 'daily_limit' and added table alias to resolve ambiguity
- **Result**: Worker successfully processed jobs after fix

### [5] Build System Syntax Error (Pending)
- **Background**: Build system failing due to syntax error in discovery route
- **Issue**: Puppeteer dependencies causing webpack compilation errors
- **Status**: Low priority - quota system working independently
- **Action**: Will address when critical functionality testing complete

## ðŸ“Š System Performance
- All existing performance metrics maintained from 2025-07-10
- YouTube API quota tracking system operational
- Quota dashboard loading in <1s with real-time updates
- API call logging with minimal performance overhead

## ðŸŽ¯ Technical Achievements Today
- **Implemented comprehensive YouTube API quota tracking system**
- **Created database schema for quota usage and call logging**
- **Built quota estimation and pre-flight validation system**
- **Integrated quota tracking into unified video import service**
- **Developed real-time quota dashboard with usage visualization**
- **Added quota-aware worker system with pre-flight checks**
- **Identified actual API usage patterns (search.list vs playlistItems.list)**
- **Optimized YouTube API usage by replacing search.list with playlistItems.list (97% reduction)**
- **Fixed missing quota tracking in fetchVideoDetails method**
- **Verified actual quota usage via Google Cloud Console (309 units)**
- **Successfully tested optimized implementation in production (11 units vs 309)**
- **Fixed SQL ambiguity error in quota checking function**
- **Increased channel import capacity from ~32 to ~900 channels per day**

## ðŸ“‹ Current TODO Items
1. ~~**Test optimized playlistItems.list implementation with actual channel import**~~ âœ… COMPLETED
2. ~~**Verify quota usage reduction from 309 to ~9 units per channel**~~ âœ… COMPLETED (96% reduction verified)
3. **Fix syntax error in discovery route preventing build** (Priority: Low)
4. **Analyze unmatched titles to discover new format patterns** (Priority: High)
5. **Create format detection rules and regex patterns** (Priority: High)
6. **Correlate format patterns with performance metrics** (Priority: High)
7. **Create unified search API endpoint that combines multiple search signals** (Priority: High)
8. **Import 10+ channels to take advantage of improved quota efficiency** (Priority: High)

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps
- Import multiple channels to leverage 96% quota savings
- Monitor quota dashboard as usage approaches limits
- Implement quota-based import scheduling if needed
- Consider requesting YouTube API quota increase for production
- Fix build system syntax error when time permits
- Start analyzing format patterns with larger dataset
