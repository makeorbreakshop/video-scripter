## ðŸ§ª Today's Work (2025-07-08)

### [1] Video-First Discovery System Implementation Completed
- **Background**: From previous session - implemented efficient video-first discovery strategy to replace expensive channel discovery approach
- **Achievement**: Successfully implemented video/channel search toggle with RSS baseline calculation system
- **API Cost Optimization**: Reduced from 5,000+ API units to 101 units (100 for video search + 1 for channel details) using RSS feeds for free baseline data
- **Technical**: Video search â†’ unique channel extraction â†’ channel details â†’ RSS parsing for recent video performance averages
- **Integration**: Added as 7th discovery method in existing dashboard with consistent UI patterns and database schema

**Implementation Summary:**
- **Search Toggle**: Channel vs Video search modes with clear explanations and different placeholders
- **Video Search Flow**: Search videos â†’ extract unique channels â†’ get channel metadata â†’ parse RSS for baselines
- **RSS Baseline Parsing**: Free YouTube RSS feeds provide recent video view counts for performance estimation
- **Database Integration**: Stores RSS baseline data in discovery_context and channel_metadata for future reference
- **API Efficiency**: 99% cost reduction while providing better channel discovery through video relevance

### [2] Claude Configuration File Corruption Resolution
- **Issue**: Claude Code configuration file at `/Users/brandoncullum/.claude.json` corrupted with 24MB size causing "Unexpected end of JSON input" errors
- **Root Cause**: Excessive conversation history accumulation in `.claude.json` file causing JSON parsing failures and preventing Claude Code startup
- **Problem**: `/compact` command creates summaries but doesn't actually reduce stored history size - full conversations remain in config file
- **Solution**: Cleared conversation history while preserving all other settings, reducing file size from 24MB to 14KB
- **Impact**: Claude Code now starts normally, all settings preserved, conversation history reset for future growth management

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Backup Creation**: Saved original corrupted config to `.claude.json.backup` for recovery if needed
- **Selective Cleanup**: Used `jq` to clear only conversation history while preserving OAuth account, project settings, tool permissions, etc.
- **File Size Reduction**: 24MB â†’ 14KB (99.9% reduction) while maintaining all functional configuration
- **Root Cause Understanding**: `/compact` provides context continuity but doesn't prevent config file bloat from long conversation storage

**Maintenance Strategy:**
- **Regular Monitoring**: Check config file size periodically when it becomes large
- **Manual Cleanup**: Clear conversation history every few weeks to prevent corruption
- **Fresh Conversations**: Use `--continue` mode less frequently, start fresh conversations more often to limit history accumulation

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps
- Continue development based on user requirements
- Monitor system performance with new video-first discovery approach
- Expand discovery capabilities based on RSS baseline effectiveness
- Test search discovery integration with existing review queue workflow
- Consider enhancing post-search display with RSS baseline performance estimates

### [3] Video Search Discovery Database Constraint Fix
- **Issue**: Video search discovery failing with database constraint violation error
- **Error**: `new row for relation "channel_discovery" violates check constraint "check_discovery_method"`
- **Root Cause**: API was using `'video_search'` as discovery method but database constraint only allows specific values including `'search'`
- **Solution**: Updated video search API to use `'search'` instead of `'video_search'` for discovery_method field
- **Impact**: Video search discovery now works properly, channels are added to discovery queue successfully

### [4] Video Search Results UI Enhancement  
- **Issue**: Video search was returning channel summaries instead of actual video results, confusing user experience
- **Problem**: User expected to see videos when searching by video, but interface showed channels with subscriber/video counts
- **Solution**: Enhanced search discovery component to display video results when searchType is 'video'
- **Implementation**: Added video result cards showing video thumbnails, titles, channel info, and action buttons to watch videos or visit channels
- **Technical**: Modified API response to include videos array with channel metadata, updated frontend to handle both video and channel result types

### [5] Competitor Channels Management Page Redesign
- **Issue**: Page layout had inconsistent margins and spacing compared to rest of application
- **Problem**: Missing proper container styling, inconsistent typography, and poor visual hierarchy  
- **Solution**: Applied consistent design system with proper margins, container styling, and page headers
- **Technical**: Added `container mx-auto max-w-7xl space-y-6 p-6` styling with proper page header and description
- **Result**: Page now matches application design standards with professional spacing and layout

### [6] Previous: Competitor Channels Management Page Enhancement
- **Issue**: Manage channels page needed improved UX with search functionality, clickable entries, and proper channel name display
- **Problem 1**: Channel names were showing as IDs (e.g., "UC_7aK9PpYTqt08ERh1MewlQ" instead of "3D Printing Nerd")
- **Problem 2**: Video counts were incorrect due to Supabase query limits (showing 10 instead of 401 for some channels)
- **Root Cause**: Inconsistent metadata field names (channel_name vs channel_title) and 46,194 competitor videos exceeding default query limits

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Frontend Enhancement**: Added Google-style instant search bar with real-time filtering
- **UI Improvements**: Removed action buttons, made channel entries clickable to open video analysis pages
- **API Optimization**: Fixed metadata field handling to check both channel_name and channel_title fields
- **Database Solution**: Created materialized view `competitor_channel_summary` for instant aggregation of 46k+ videos
- **Performance**: Reduced load time from potential timeout to <200ms using pre-computed aggregations

**Materialized View Benefits:**
- **Instant Queries**: Pre-aggregated channel statistics eliminate need to process 46k rows on each request
- **Correct Counts**: Accurate video counts for all channels (e.g., 401 for 3D Printing Nerd)
- **Metadata Priority**: Intelligently selects best metadata (prioritizes entries with channel_stats)
- **Subscriber/Thumbnail Data**: Properly extracts and displays subscriber counts and channel thumbnails
