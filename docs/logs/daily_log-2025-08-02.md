# Daily Log - 2025-08-02

## Session Timeline

- **Start Time**: Morning session
- **Session Focus**: UI Updates, BERTopic Integration, and Unified Import Enhancement

## Today's Progress

### 1. YouTube Dashboard Sidebar Cleanup

**Task**: Remove "Age-Adjusted Demo" and "Debug View" from sidebar navigation

**Implementation**:
- Located `/components/youtube/youtube-sidebar.tsx`
- Removed two menu items from navigation array
- Maintained clean UI with only essential dashboard sections

**Result**: Simplified sidebar navigation for better user experience

### 2. BERTopic Hierarchy Visualization

**Task**: Add BERTopic hierarchy structure to Database Stats tab with counts

**Context**: Building on August 1st's 216-topic BERTopic implementation

**Implementation**:
- Created `/app/api/topics/hierarchy/route.ts` - API endpoint for topic hierarchy data
- Built `/components/youtube/topic-hierarchy.tsx` - Collapsible tree view component
- Integrated component into Database Stats tab

**Technical Details**:
- Fetches hierarchy using RPC function `get_topic_hierarchy_with_counts`
- Displays 3-level structure: Domain → Niche → Micro-topic
- Shows video counts and percentages for each level
- Collapsible nodes with ChevronRight/Down icons

**Result**: Interactive visualization of 216 BERTopic clusters with distribution data

### 3. Unified Import BERTopic Integration Investigation

**Task**: Check if unified import process was using new BERTopic classifications

**Discovery**:
- Found unified import was using OLD BERTopic system (bertopic_clusters table)
- Recent imports showed generic topic IDs (topic_55, etc.) not descriptive names
- New model has 216 topics with names like "Woodworking Projects & Tool Reviews"

**Issue**: Gap between new BERTopic model and unified import pipeline

### 4. BERTopic Classification Service Implementation

**Task**: Update unified import to use new BERTopic model from August 1st

**Implementation**:
- Created `/lib/bertopic-classification-service.ts` - New service using August 1st model
- Updated `/lib/unified-video-import.ts` to use new classification service
- Service uses Pinecone similarity search to find nearest topics
- Maps to descriptive names from `better_topic_names_v2.json`

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// New classification approach:
- Fetch video embeddings
- Use Pinecone similarity search to find similar videos
- Look up their BERTopic assignments
- Assign most common topic from similar videos
- Store with bertopic_version: 'v1_2025-08-01'
```

**Result**: Unified import now assigns descriptive topic names using new model

### 5. Additional Services Investigation

**Task**: Explore other BERTopic-related services in codebase

**Findings**:
- Found `/lib/bertopic-mapping-service.ts` - Simple mapping service for cluster IDs
- Found `bertopic_proper_hierarchy_20250801_134718.json` - Contains hierarchy data
- Confirmed new classification service is the correct approach for unified import

**Note**: The mapping service appears to be a simpler alternative, but classification service provides better similarity-based assignments

## Implementation Summary

### Code Changes
- ✅ Removed sidebar menu items for cleaner UI
- ✅ Created topic hierarchy API endpoint
- ✅ Built interactive hierarchy visualization component
- ✅ Created BERTopic classification service
- ✅ Updated unified import to use new BERTopic model

### System Status
- BERTopic hierarchy visualization live on Database Stats tab
- Unified import now using descriptive topic names
- Classification using Pinecone similarity search
- All new imports will have proper topic assignments

## Next Steps
- Monitor new video imports to verify BERTopic assignments
- Consider updating existing videos with old topic IDs
- Potentially add topic filtering to video search/discovery

## Technical Notes

### BERTopic Integration Flow
1. Video import triggers classification
2. Embedding fetched (title or summary)
3. Pinecone finds 10 similar videos
4. Database lookup for their topic assignments
5. Most common topic assigned to new video
6. Stored with descriptive name and hierarchy

### Key Files Modified
- `/components/youtube/youtube-sidebar.tsx`
- `/app/api/topics/hierarchy/route.ts` (created)
- `/components/youtube/topic-hierarchy.tsx` (created)
- `/lib/bertopic-classification-service.ts` (created)
- `/lib/unified-video-import.ts`

### Performance Considerations
- Classification adds ~1-2 seconds per batch
- Pinecone queries optimized with topK=10
- Fallback to "Uncategorized" for outliers
- Confidence scores tracked for future analysis

## Afternoon Session - Continued Development

### 6. Unified Import Error Fixes

**Task**: Fix multiple import errors preventing unified import from working

**Issues Fixed**:
1. **Pinecone Service Error**: `pineconeService.getIndex is not a function`
   - Fixed by importing Pinecone directly and creating new client instance
   
2. **BERTopic Import Error**: Module not found due to missing .ts extension
   - Added `.ts` extension to import statement
   
3. **JSON Import Error**: ES modules require import attribute for JSON
   - Added `with { type: 'json' }` to JSON imports

4. **Summary Embedding Dimension Error**: Vector dimension 1536 vs expected 512
   - Fixed by adding `dimensions: 512` to OpenAI embeddings call

**Result**: Unified import now working with all components integrated

### 7. Topic Hierarchy Dark Theme Update

**Task**: Fix topic hierarchy component visibility on dark theme

**Implementation**:
- Updated color classes with proper dark mode variants
- Used opacity-based backgrounds for better dark theme support
- Added explicit dark text colors for all elements

**Result**: Topic hierarchy now fully visible and styled correctly on dark theme

### 8. BERTopic Classification Process Reordering

**Task**: Fix BERTopic classification to use combined embeddings as originally intended

**Context**: Discovered BERTopic model was trained on combined embeddings (30% title + 70% summary) but classification was happening before summary embeddings were available

**Implementation**:
1. Reordered unified import process flow:
   - Moved BERTopic classification to Step 6 (after summary embeddings)
   - Ensured both title and summary embeddings available before classification
   
2. Updated classification to combine embeddings:
   - 30% title + 70% summary weighting (matching training data)
   - Fallback to title-only if summary missing

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// Combined embedding calculation
const combinedEmbedding = titleEmbedding.embedding.map((val, idx) => 
  0.3 * val + 0.7 * summaryEmbedding.embedding[idx]
);
```

**Result**: 192/196 videos used combined embeddings, 4 used title-only fallback

### 9. BERTopic Misclassification Investigation

**Task**: Investigate why woodworking videos were being classified as "Home Cleaning & Organization"

**Root Cause Discovery**:
- BERTopic model trained on combined embeddings (30% title + 70% summary)
- Classification service searches in default Pinecone namespace (title-only embeddings)
- Mismatch between embedding spaces causing wrong "similar" videos to be found

**Key Insight**: Passing combined embeddings to search in title-only space creates vector space mismatch

**Temporary Fix**:
- Reverted to using title-only embeddings for BERTopic classification
- Ensures consistency between query embeddings and search space
- Added TODO comment for proper solution

**Proper Solution (TODO)**:
1. Create new Pinecone namespace for combined embeddings
2. Generate and store combined embeddings for all classified videos
3. Update BERTopic service to search in combined namespace
4. Revert to using combined embeddings for classification

**Result**: Classifications now consistent but using reduced accuracy (title-only instead of combined)

## Implementation Summary - Full Day

### Code Changes
- ✅ Fixed multiple import errors (Pinecone, ES modules, dimensions)
- ✅ Updated topic hierarchy for dark theme support
- ✅ Reordered classification process for proper embedding availability
- ✅ Implemented combined embedding classification
- ✅ Diagnosed and fixed vector space mismatch issue
- ✅ Reverted to title-only embeddings as temporary fix

### System Status
- Unified import fully functional with all components
- BERTopic using title-only embeddings (temporary)
- 100% classification coverage for imported videos
- Dark theme support complete for topic hierarchy

### Critical Findings
- Vector space mismatch causes severe misclassification
- Combined embeddings improve accuracy but require matching search space
- Current BERTopic clusters may have training data issues (woodworking in home cleaning)

### Next Steps
- Create combined embeddings namespace in Pinecone
- Retrain or refine BERTopic model for better cluster separation
- Implement proper combined embedding search
- Review and fix misclassified clusters
