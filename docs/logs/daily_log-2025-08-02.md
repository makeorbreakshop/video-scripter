# Daily Log - 2025-08-02

## Session Timeline

- **Start Time**: Morning session
- **Session Focus**: UI Updates, BERTopic Integration, and Unified Import Enhancement

## Today's Progress

### 1. YouTube Dashboard Sidebar Cleanup

**Task**: Remove "Age-Adjusted Demo" and "Debug View" from sidebar navigation

**Implementation**:
- Located `/components/youtube/youtube-sidebar.tsx`
- Removed two menu items from navigation array
- Maintained clean UI with only essential dashboard sections

**Result**: Simplified sidebar navigation for better user experience

### 2. BERTopic Hierarchy Visualization

**Task**: Add BERTopic hierarchy structure to Database Stats tab with counts

**Context**: Building on August 1st's 216-topic BERTopic implementation

**Implementation**:
- Created `/app/api/topics/hierarchy/route.ts` - API endpoint for topic hierarchy data
- Built `/components/youtube/topic-hierarchy.tsx` - Collapsible tree view component
- Integrated component into Database Stats tab

**Technical Details**:
- Fetches hierarchy using RPC function `get_topic_hierarchy_with_counts`
- Displays 3-level structure: Domain → Niche → Micro-topic
- Shows video counts and percentages for each level
- Collapsible nodes with ChevronRight/Down icons

**Result**: Interactive visualization of 216 BERTopic clusters with distribution data

### 3. Unified Import BERTopic Integration Investigation

**Task**: Check if unified import process was using new BERTopic classifications

**Discovery**:
- Found unified import was using OLD BERTopic system (bertopic_clusters table)
- Recent imports showed generic topic IDs (topic_55, etc.) not descriptive names
- New model has 216 topics with names like "Woodworking Projects & Tool Reviews"

**Issue**: Gap between new BERTopic model and unified import pipeline

### 4. BERTopic Classification Service Implementation

**Task**: Update unified import to use new BERTopic model from August 1st

**Implementation**:
- Created `/lib/bertopic-classification-service.ts` - New service using August 1st model
- Updated `/lib/unified-video-import.ts` to use new classification service
- Service uses Pinecone similarity search to find nearest topics
- Maps to descriptive names from `better_topic_names_v2.json`

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// New classification approach:
- Fetch video embeddings
- Use Pinecone similarity search to find similar videos
- Look up their BERTopic assignments
- Assign most common topic from similar videos
- Store with bertopic_version: 'v1_2025-08-01'
```

**Result**: Unified import now assigns descriptive topic names using new model

### 5. Additional Services Investigation

**Task**: Explore other BERTopic-related services in codebase

**Findings**:
- Found `/lib/bertopic-mapping-service.ts` - Simple mapping service for cluster IDs
- Found `bertopic_proper_hierarchy_20250801_134718.json` - Contains hierarchy data
- Confirmed new classification service is the correct approach for unified import

**Note**: The mapping service appears to be a simpler alternative, but classification service provides better similarity-based assignments

## Implementation Summary

### Code Changes
- ✅ Removed sidebar menu items for cleaner UI
- ✅ Created topic hierarchy API endpoint
- ✅ Built interactive hierarchy visualization component
- ✅ Created BERTopic classification service
- ✅ Updated unified import to use new BERTopic model

### System Status
- BERTopic hierarchy visualization live on Database Stats tab
- Unified import now using descriptive topic names
- Classification using Pinecone similarity search
- All new imports will have proper topic assignments

## Next Steps
- Monitor new video imports to verify BERTopic assignments
- Consider updating existing videos with old topic IDs
- Potentially add topic filtering to video search/discovery

## Technical Notes

### BERTopic Integration Flow
1. Video import triggers classification
2. Embedding fetched (title or summary)
3. Pinecone finds 10 similar videos
4. Database lookup for their topic assignments
5. Most common topic assigned to new video
6. Stored with descriptive name and hierarchy

### Key Files Modified
- `/components/youtube/youtube-sidebar.tsx`
- `/app/api/topics/hierarchy/route.ts` (created)
- `/components/youtube/topic-hierarchy.tsx` (created)
- `/lib/bertopic-classification-service.ts` (created)
- `/lib/unified-video-import.ts`

### Performance Considerations
- Classification adds ~1-2 seconds per batch
- Pinecone queries optimized with topK=10
- Fallback to "Uncategorized" for outliers
- Confidence scores tracked for future analysis

## Afternoon Session - Continued Development

### 6. Unified Import Error Fixes

**Task**: Fix multiple import errors preventing unified import from working

**Issues Fixed**:
1. **Pinecone Service Error**: `pineconeService.getIndex is not a function`
   - Fixed by importing Pinecone directly and creating new client instance
   
2. **BERTopic Import Error**: Module not found due to missing .ts extension
   - Added `.ts` extension to import statement
   
3. **JSON Import Error**: ES modules require import attribute for JSON
   - Added `with { type: 'json' }` to JSON imports

4. **Summary Embedding Dimension Error**: Vector dimension 1536 vs expected 512
   - Fixed by adding `dimensions: 512` to OpenAI embeddings call

**Result**: Unified import now working with all components integrated

### 7. Topic Hierarchy Dark Theme Update

**Task**: Fix topic hierarchy component visibility on dark theme

**Implementation**:
- Updated color classes with proper dark mode variants
- Used opacity-based backgrounds for better dark theme support
- Added explicit dark text colors for all elements

**Result**: Topic hierarchy now fully visible and styled correctly on dark theme

### 8. BERTopic Classification Process Reordering

**Task**: Fix BERTopic classification to use combined embeddings as originally intended

**Context**: Discovered BERTopic model was trained on combined embeddings (30% title + 70% summary) but classification was happening before summary embeddings were available

**Implementation**:
1. Reordered unified import process flow:
   - Moved BERTopic classification to Step 6 (after summary embeddings)
   - Ensured both title and summary embeddings available before classification
   
2. Updated classification to combine embeddings:
   - 30% title + 70% summary weighting (matching training data)
   - Fallback to title-only if summary missing

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// Combined embedding calculation
const combinedEmbedding = titleEmbedding.embedding.map((val, idx) => 
  0.3 * val + 0.7 * summaryEmbedding.embedding[idx]
);
```

**Result**: 192/196 videos used combined embeddings, 4 used title-only fallback

### 9. BERTopic Misclassification Investigation

**Task**: Investigate why woodworking videos were being classified as "Home Cleaning & Organization"

**Root Cause Discovery**:
- BERTopic model trained on combined embeddings (30% title + 70% summary)
- Classification service searches in default Pinecone namespace (title-only embeddings)
- Mismatch between embedding spaces causing wrong "similar" videos to be found

**Key Insight**: Passing combined embeddings to search in title-only space creates vector space mismatch

**Temporary Fix**:
- Reverted to using title-only embeddings for BERTopic classification
- Ensures consistency between query embeddings and search space
- Added TODO comment for proper solution

**Proper Solution (TODO)**:
1. Create new Pinecone namespace for combined embeddings
2. Generate and store combined embeddings for all classified videos
3. Update BERTopic service to search in combined namespace
4. Revert to using combined embeddings for classification

**Result**: Classifications now consistent but using reduced accuracy (title-only instead of combined)

## Implementation Summary - Full Day

### Code Changes
- ✅ Fixed multiple import errors (Pinecone, ES modules, dimensions)
- ✅ Updated topic hierarchy for dark theme support
- ✅ Reordered classification process for proper embedding availability
- ✅ Implemented combined embedding classification
- ✅ Diagnosed and fixed vector space mismatch issue
- ✅ Reverted to title-only embeddings as temporary fix

### System Status
- Unified import fully functional with all components
- BERTopic using title-only embeddings (temporary)
- 100% classification coverage for imported videos
- Dark theme support complete for topic hierarchy

### Critical Findings
- Vector space mismatch causes severe misclassification
- Combined embeddings improve accuracy but require matching search space
- Current BERTopic clusters may have training data issues (woodworking in home cleaning)

### Next Steps
- Create combined embeddings namespace in Pinecone
- Retrain or refine BERTopic model for better cluster separation
- Implement proper combined embedding search
- Review and fix misclassified clusters

## Evening Session - View Tracking Fix

### 10. View Tracking System 1000 Row Limit Fix

**Task**: Fix view tracking system only fetching 951 videos instead of the expected 16,650

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- View tracking was hitting Supabase's default 1000 row limit
- Complex join query with `videos!inner(published_at)` was limiting results
- The system showed 16,650 videos needed tracking but only processed 951

**Investigation**:
- Found SQL fix files in git: `fix-get-videos-to-track-paginated.sql`, `fix-get-videos-to-track-complete.sql`
- Discovered the service had a `fetchVideosToTrackRange` method designed to bypass the limit
- The method was using a complex join that was failing

**Implementation**:
1. **Separated Complex Query**: Split the join query into two simpler queries:
   - First: Fetch all video IDs from `view_tracking_priority` that need tracking
   - Second: Fetch video metadata (`published_at`) separately in batches

2. **Improved Pagination Logic**:
   - Properly handle fetching beyond 1000 rows using `.range()` method
   - Added exact count tracking to verify all records are fetched
   - Fixed batch detection logic

3. **Code Changes**:
   ```typescript
   // Old approach - complex join limiting results
   .select(`
     video_id,
     priority_tier,
     videos!inner(published_at)
   `)
   
   // New approach - separate queries
   // 1. Get all video IDs
   .select('video_id, priority_tier')
   
   // 2. Fetch video data in batches
   .from('videos')
   .select('id, published_at')
   .in('id', videoIds)
   ```

**Technical Details**:
- The complex join was hitting query complexity limits
- Supabase was returning only partial results (951 rows)
- By splitting into simpler queries, we can fetch unlimited rows
- Each query stays under complexity limits while achieving the same result

**Result**: View tracking system can now fetch all 16,650 videos that need tracking across all priority tiers

### 11. BERTopic Centroid Discovery

**Task**: Investigate using cluster centroids for BERTopic classification

**Discovery**:
- Found that `bertopic_clusters` table has centroid embeddings stored
- Current centroids are from old model, not August 1st model
- Using centroids would solve the vector space mismatch issue

**Plan for Centroid-Based Classification**:
1. Extract centroids from August 1st BERTopic model
2. Calculate centroids from existing classified videos in database
3. Store centroids in bertopic_clusters table with proper topic names
4. Update classification service to use distance-to-centroid approach

**Advantage**: Centroid-based classification works with any embedding type (title-only, combined, etc.) without needing to search for similar videos

## Implementation Summary - Complete Day

### Morning Session
- UI cleanup and BERTopic integration
- Fixed multiple unified import errors
- Implemented combined embedding classification

### Afternoon Session  
- Diagnosed vector space mismatch issue
- Reverted to title-only embeddings temporarily
- Updated dark theme support

### Evening Session
- Fixed view tracking 1000 row limit issue
- Discovered centroid-based classification opportunity

### System Status
- View tracking: Now fetches all 16,650 videos correctly
- BERTopic: Using title-only embeddings (temporary)
- Unified import: Fully functional with all components
- Next: Implement centroid-based classification for accuracy

## Night Session - Performance Crisis & IOPS Optimization

### 12. Emergency: Mass Video Update Triggered

**Incident**: Dashboard accidentally triggered an "Update All" operation attempting to update all 184,053 videos in the database

**Timeline**:
- User noticed extreme IOPS spike on database
- Discovered 14,253 videos had already been processed
- Emergency intervention required to stop the operation

**Actions Taken**:
1. **Updated Cancel Endpoint** (`/api/view-tracking/cancel/route.ts`):
   - Modified to cancel ALL running/pending view_tracking jobs
   - Fixed enum status error (removed invalid "running" status)
   - Added detailed error logging for debugging

2. **Successfully Stopped the Mass Update**:
   - Called DELETE endpoint to cancel all jobs
   - Verified no active jobs remaining in database
   - Confirmed video count stopped increasing at 14,253

3. **Added Logging**:
   - Added console.log to update-all POST endpoint to track calls
   - Double-confirmation dialog already in place (unclear how it was bypassed)

**Root Cause**: Still unclear what triggered the initial update-all call despite confirmation dialogs

### 13. Dashboard Polling IOPS Crisis

**Discovery**: Dashboard was continuously hammering the database with expensive queries

**Issue Details**:
- `/api/view-tracking/update-all` GET endpoint was counting ALL 184k+ videos every poll
- `/api/view-tracking/stats` making 6 separate queries in a loop for tier counts
- Dashboard polls every 30 seconds but cache was only 60 seconds
- Result: Extreme IOPS load from constant database queries

**Optimizations Implemented**:

1. **Extended Cache Duration**:
   ```typescript
   // Before: 60 second cache
   export const updateAllStatsCache = new SimpleCache(60);
   
   // After: 5 minute cache for expensive queries
   export const updateAllStatsCache = new SimpleCache(300);
   ```

2. **Optimized Update-All Stats Query**:
   - Changed from `select('*')` to `select('id')` for counting
   - Added comment about aggressive caching for static counts
   - Reduced query complexity for counting operations

3. **Eliminated Loop Queries in Stats Endpoint**:
   - Removed 6 separate tier count queries in for-loop
   - Used already-fetched tier stats for estimation
   - Calculated eligible percentages based on tier frequency
   - Result: 6 queries reduced to 0 (using existing data)

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// Before: 6 queries in a loop
for (let tier = 1; tier <= 6; tier++) {
  const { count } = await supabase
    .from('view_tracking_priority')
    .select('*', { count: 'exact' })
    .eq('priority_tier', tier)
    .or('next_track_date.is.null,next_track_date.lte.today()');
}

// After: Use existing tier stats with estimation
const eligiblePercentage = tierStat.tier === 1 ? 1 : 1 / tierStat.tier;
const eligibleCount = Math.floor(tierStat.count * eligiblePercentage);
```

**Result**: 
- Dramatic reduction in database queries
- Extended caching reduces hits by 80%
- Eliminated expensive loop queries entirely
- IOPS should return to normal levels

### Final Day Summary
