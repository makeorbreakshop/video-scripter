# Video Scripter â€” Working Dev Log (2025-07-03)
- This gets refreshed daily and the core info is saved to condensed logs
- Goal is to give Claude good active context for what we are working on

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Video Scripter is a Next.js 15 application for analyzing YouTube videos and creating content using AI. Features comprehensive video analysis pipeline with the "Skyscraper" framework, vector database integration, and multi-phase workflow for content creation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status
- **Database**: 208 user videos + 3,580+ competitor videos from multiple channels
- **Performance**: Packaging analysis optimized with <100ms response times (95%+ improvement)
- **Competitor Analysis**: Full system with import/refresh capabilities for competitive intelligence
- **Authentication**: RLS issues resolved, development workflow streamlined
- **UI/UX**: Enhanced packaging interface with compact filters and improved readability

## ðŸ“‹ Development Tasks

### Current Working Context
All major systems are operational:
- âœ… Packaging analysis with high-performance filtering
- âœ… Competitor import and analysis system  
- âœ… Research channel expansion (107+ channels)
- âœ… Database performance optimization
- âœ… Authentication and access control fixes
- âœ… Enhanced shorts filtering and UI improvements

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
- **Core Tables**: `videos`, `chunks`, `analyses`, `patterns`, `scripts`
- **Analytics**: `analytics_data`, `baseline_analytics` with 47-column schema
- **Competitor System**: Enhanced `videos` table with `is_competitor`, `data_source` flags
- **Performance**: `get_packaging_performance()` PostgreSQL function for optimized queries

### API Integration
- **YouTube Data API v3**: Channel search, video metadata, competitor imports
- **YouTube Analytics API**: 36 comprehensive metrics with OAuth authentication
- **YouTube Reporting API**: Historical bulk data with 99.9% quota efficiency
- **AI APIs**: OpenAI embeddings, Anthropic Claude analysis

### Performance Optimizations
- **Database Functions**: Single RPC calls instead of N+1 queries
- **Filtering**: Multi-layered shorts detection with null duration handling
- **UI**: Compact filter controls, larger thumbnails, enhanced readability
- **Caching**: Strategic indexing and materialized views for enterprise-grade speeds

## ðŸš€ Recent Achievements (2025-07-02)
- **Massive Performance Gains**: 2-5 seconds â†’ <100ms (95%+ improvement)
- **Full Competitor System**: 3,580+ competitor videos with fair baselines
- **Authentication Resolution**: RLS policy fixes, service role endpoints
- **Enhanced Filtering**: 336 shorts filtered with robust duration handling
- **UI/UX Improvements**: 60% more compact filters, better thumbnail visibility
- **System Stability**: Critical bug fixes maintaining 208+3,580 video database

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Priorities
Ready for new features or optimizations as needed. Current system is stable and performant.

## ðŸ“Š System Metrics
- **Videos**: 208 user + 3,580+ competitor = 3,788+ total
- **Performance**: <100ms packaging analysis queries
- **Coverage**: 107+ research channels with expansion capability
- **API Efficiency**: Optimized YouTube quota usage with intelligent filtering
- **UI Response**: <2s dashboard loads with real-time data

## ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Updates (2025-07-03)
### [1] Packaging Card Redesign
- **Updated cards to match YouTube Browse Outliers layout**
  - Moved performance badge from thumbnail overlay to next to title text
  - Added channel avatars and improved typography hierarchy
