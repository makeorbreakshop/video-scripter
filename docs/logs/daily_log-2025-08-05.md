## Session Timeline

- **Start Time**: ~10:00 AM
- **Session Focus**: Google PSE Search Integration Testing and Bug Fixes

## Today's Progress

### 1. Google PSE Search Endpoint Testing and Fixes

**Task**: User requested comprehensive pytest tests for Google PSE search endpoint to ensure full search process works correctly

**Implementation**:
- Fixed import errors in `/app/api/google-pse/search/route.ts` (changed from non-existent `@/lib/supabase/server` to `@/lib/supabase-client`)
- Fixed database schema mismatch - discovered table uses `channel_title` not `channel_name`
- Fixed column name mismatch for duplicate detection - table uses `custom_url` not `channel_url`
- Added temporary channel ID generation for channels discovered via @handles
- Created comprehensive pytest test suite in `/tests/test_google_pse_search.py`
- Created integration test suite in `/tests/test_pse_integration.py`
- Created quick test script `/test_pse_endpoint.js` for manual testing

**Result**: 
- Endpoint now successfully discovers YouTube channels via Google PSE
- Proper duplicate detection working (10 channels found, 0 added on second run)
- Channels stored correctly in `discovered_channels` table
- All required fields populated including `discovery_method: 'google_pse'`

### 2. Database Schema Verification

**Task**: Verify discovered_channels table structure for proper integration

**Technical Details**:
- Queried information_schema to get actual column names
- Key columns: `channel_id`, `channel_title` (not channel_name), `custom_url` (not channel_url)
- Required fields include temporary ID generation when channel ID not available

**Testing Results**:
- Successfully inserted 10 channels from "Circuit design tutorials" search
- Duplicate detection correctly identifies all 10 as existing on re-run
- Channels marked with `is_processed: false` for later YouTube API verification

**Impact**: Google PSE integration now fully functional for discovering new YouTube channels without using YouTube API quota

## Implementation Summary

### Code Changes
- [x] Fixed `/app/api/google-pse/search/route.ts` import and schema issues
- [x] Updated column references from channel_name to channel_title
- [x] Updated column references from channel_url to custom_url
- [x] Added temporary ID generation for channels without IDs
- [x] Created pytest test suite with mocking for full coverage
- [x] Created integration test suite for HTTP endpoint testing

### System Status
- Google PSE endpoint: ‚úÖ Fully functional
- Duplicate detection: ‚úÖ Working correctly
- Database insertion: ‚úÖ Successful with proper schema
- Quota tracking: ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic implementation (needs persistent storage)

### Critical Fixes
- Import error: `@/lib/supabase/server` ‚Üí `@/lib/supabase-client`
- Schema mismatch: `channel_name` ‚Üí `channel_title`
- Duplicate check: `channel_url` ‚Üí `custom_url`
- Missing required fields: Added temporary channel_id generation

## Next Steps
- Implement persistent quota tracking in database
- Add channel resolution to convert @handles to channel IDs
- Set up automated discovery runs based on topic gaps
- Add monitoring for discovery success rates

## Technical Notes

### Google PSE Integration
- Uses Google Custom Search API with YouTube-specific search engine
- 100 free searches per day quota limit
- Extracts channels from both video and channel search results
- Confidence levels: high (has channel ID), medium (@handle only), low (minimal info)

### Database Schema Mapping
- `channel_title` - Channel name from search results
- `custom_url` - Full YouTube URL (used for duplicate detection)
- `channel_id` - YouTube channel ID or temporary ID for @handles
- `discovery_method` - Set to 'google_pse'
- `search_query` - Original search query used
- `is_processed` - False until YouTube API verification

### 3. Import Tab Integration Fix

**Task**: Fix channels not appearing properly in import tab - showing as "Unknown Channel"

**Implementation**:
- Added insertion to `channel_discovery` table (import tab reads from this, not `discovered_channels`)
- Fixed NOT NULL constraint by using 'google_pse' as source_channel_id
- Updated duplicate detection to check both tables
- Channels now show with proper names and metadata in import UI

### 4. YouTube API Channel Enrichment

**Task**: Add second step to fetch actual channel data from YouTube API

**Implementation**:
- Created `fetchChannelDataFromYouTube()` function to enrich discovered channels
- Batch processing for channels with IDs (up to 50 per API call)
- Individual `forHandle` calls for @handle resolution
- Proper quota tracking via `quotaTracker.trackAPICall()`
- Enriched data includes: subscriber count, video count, description, thumbnail

**Result**:
- Channels now display with full data in import tab
- Example: "Haseeb Electronics Urdu" - 69,100 subscribers, 1,114 videos
- Proper channel IDs resolved from @handles
- All metadata stored in both database tables

### 5. Google PSE Quota Tracking Persistence

**Task**: Implement persistent quota tracking that survives server restarts

**Implementation**:
- Created `google_pse_quota` table with daily tracking
- Added database functions: `increment_google_pse_quota()` and `get_google_pse_quota_status()`
- Updated `google-pse-service.ts` to use database for quota storage
- Quota now persists across server restarts (was in-memory only)

**Result**: Daily quota (3/100 used) properly tracked in database

### 6. Debug Mode for Search Results

**Task**: Add debug mode to view raw Google PSE search results

**Implementation**:
- Added debug toggle button in UI (üêõ Debug ON/OFF)
- Updated API to return raw PSE results when debug enabled
- Shows expandable raw data for each search including:
  - Full pagemap data with channel info
  - Video metadata and snippets
  - Structured data extraction details

**Result**: Users can now see exactly what Google PSE returns and how channels are extracted

### 7. UI Cleanup

**Task**: Remove unnecessary UI sections per user request

**Changes**:
- Removed "Quick Searches" section with predefined buttons
- Removed "This Week's Performance" statistics card

**Result**: Cleaner, more focused interface for search operations

### 8. Data-Driven Search Query Generation

**Task**: Generate search queries using existing database to expand both breadth (new topics) and depth (more channels in existing topics)

**Implementation**:
- Analyzed 60K+ outlier videos (no topic classification) to identify patterns
- Queried channels with many unclassified videos (e.g., LegalEagle with 478 outliers)
- Searched for common phrases and patterns in outlier titles
- Identified underserved topics with high engagement but few channels

**Process**:
1. **Outlier Mining**: 
   - SQL queries to find repeated phrases in unclassified videos
   - Identified new topic areas: legal education, traditional crafts, sustainable living
   
2. **Topic Depth Analysis**:
   - Found existing topics with <20 channels but high view counts
   - Examples: AI trading (3 channels, 21M views), Audio Engineering (3 channels, 826K views)

3. **Search Query Generation**:
   - 20 queries for new topics from outliers
   - 20 queries to add depth to existing high-performing topics
   - Focus on educational creators with business potential

**Generated 40 Search Queries**:
- New topics: legal education, blacksmithing, ceramics, leatherworking, homesteading
- Topic depth: AI trading, full-stack development, art education, woodworking specialties
- Business indicators: masterclass, bootcamp, professional, course

### 9. Refined Search Query Strategy

**Task**: Validate search queries against existing BERTopic classifications to avoid duplicating existing topics

**Discovery Process**:
- Initial assumption: Outliers represent new topics not in database
- Reality check: Found we have 645 distinct topics across 263 niches
- Key insight: Many "outliers" (legal, blacksmithing, etc.) likely belong to existing topics but weren't classified correctly
- Example: "Off-Grid Living" already exists as topic 164 in Lifestyle domain

**Revised Approach**:
1. **Problem with outliers**: 60K outliers may be misclassified rather than representing new topics
   - Channels like Matthew Cremona (woodworking) have outliers that should be classified
   - LegalEagle has 478 outliers but legal content may already have a topic

2. **Better strategy**: Target truly niche educational areas and business-focused content
   - Niche skills: ASL, braille, speed reading, memory techniques
   - Performance arts: voice acting, beatboxing, ventriloquism
   - Modern business education: platform-specific tutorials (Etsy, Shopify, TikTok Shop)
   - Creator economy: course creation, newsletter monetization, community building

**Key Learning**: 
- Don't assume outliers = new topics
- Check existing topic coverage before generating "new topic" searches
- Focus on specific, underserved educational niches
- Prioritize business/monetization education (higher chance of being monetized channels)

### 10. Bulk Import Modal for Search Queries

**Task**: Build a bulk import modal where users can paste multiple search queries at once

**Implementation**:
- Added "Bulk Import" button that opens a modal dialog
- Large textarea for pasting multiple queries (one per line)
- Automatic cleaning of common LLM output formats:
  - Removes numbered list prefixes (1., 2), etc.)
  - Strips quotes (double, single, and smart quotes)
  - Removes bullet points (-, *, ‚Ä¢)
  - Trims whitespace
- Live preview showing cleaned queries and count
- "Copy Examples" button with 12 sample queries
- Shows how many queries are new vs duplicates

**Example Cleaning**:
```
Input:  1. "ASL sign language tutorials"
Output: ASL sign language tutorials
```

**Result**: Users can now paste lists directly from ChatGPT/Claude without manual cleanup

### 11. Batch Search UI Improvements

**Task**: Fix issue where batch searches overwrote previous results - user wanted to see all search results

**Implementation**:
- Modified search handling to support batch mode
- Added progress indicator showing "Running 2/4" during batch execution
- Batch results are collected and added all at once (preserves all results)
- Each search result is now collapsible:
  - Shows summary with counts by default
  - Click "‚ñ∂ Show X discovered channels" to expand details
  - Each search maintains independent expand/collapse state
- Stores up to 20 recent results (increased from 5)
- Individual queue items can be run separately (removes from queue on completion)

**Technical Changes**:
- `runSingleSearch()` now accepts `isBatchMode` parameter
- Batch progress tracked with `batchProgress` state
- Results array expanded with `expandedResults` state for UI control
- Reverse order insertion to show newest first

**Result**: 
- All batch search results preserved as separate entries
- Better visibility into what each search discovered
- No more data loss between searches
- Progress tracking during batch execution

### 12. Channel Filtering System

**Task**: Add quality filters to ensure only established, active, English-language channels are imported

**Implementation**:
- **Subscriber Filter**: Minimum 1,000 subscribers required
- **Activity Filter**: Must have published video in last 6 months
- **Language Filter**: English content detection via character analysis
- Filters applied after enrichment to minimize API calls
- Shows filter reasons in UI for transparency

**Technical Details**:
- Fetches channel's uploads playlist to check recent activity
- Uses regex patterns to detect non-Latin scripts (Arabic, Chinese, Cyrillic, etc.)
- Only checks activity if other filters pass (saves 2 API calls per channel)
- Updates `meets_threshold` field in database

**Result**: System now filters ~15-20% of discovered channels, ensuring quality

### 13. Duplicate Handling Improvements

**Task**: Fix duplicate constraint violations when same channel appears in multiple searches

**Implementation**:
- Enhanced duplicate detection to check both URLs and channel IDs
- Changed from `insert` to `upsert` with `ignoreDuplicates: true`
- Suppresses expected constraint violation errors (code 23505)
- Properly handles cross-search duplicates in batch mode

**Result**: Clean batch execution without error spam, accurate duplicate counts

### 14. Channel Selection and Batch Import Implementation

**Task**: Add individual channel selection functionality to discovery review queue to enable selective batch imports

**Implementation**:
- Added individual checkboxes to each pending channel in unified review queue
- Implemented "Select All" functionality with channel count display
- Added batch action buttons for selected channels:
  - "Approve Selected (X)" - Approves only selected channels
  - "Batch Import Selected (X)" - Imports selected channels through job queue
  - "Reject Selected (X)" - Rejects selected channels
- Smart state management clears selections on filter changes and after successful operations
- Preserved existing bulk functionality while adding granular control

**Technical Details**:
- Updated `/components/youtube/unified-review-queue.tsx` with selection state management
- Added `selectedChannelIds` Set state for tracking individual selections
- Integrated with existing `bulkAction` function and job queue system
- Uses existing `/api/youtube/discovery/bulk-validate` endpoint
- Maintains backward compatibility with current workflow

**Result**: Users can now select specific channels (e.g., 10-15 promising ones from 226 discovered) and batch import only those, providing much better control over the import process.

### 15. Pinecone Batching Issue Resolution

**Task**: Fix critical Pinecone vector upsert failure that was causing batch import pipeline failures

**Problem Identified**:
- Pinecone limit: 1,000 vectors per request maximum
- System attempted to upload 1,187 vectors in single request
- Error: "Number of provided vectors: 1187 exceeds the maximum amount per request: 1000"
- Pipeline exited early, preventing classifications from running

**Implementation**:
- Fixed `/lib/pinecone-service.ts` `upsertEmbeddings()` method to include proper batching
- Added BATCH_SIZE constant of 1,000 vectors
- Implemented chunking logic for large batches:
  - Single batch if ‚â§1,000 vectors
  - Multiple batches with progress logging if >1,000 vectors
- Added detailed logging: "Uploading batch 1/2 (1000 vectors)", "Uploading batch 2/2 (187 vectors)"

**Analysis of Failed Import**:
- 1,187 videos successfully imported to database ‚úÖ
- 1,187 title embeddings actually succeeded despite error ‚úÖ
- 1,185 thumbnail embeddings succeeded (only 2 failed) ‚úÖ
- 957 LLM summaries generated (230 missing) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- 0 topic classifications due to early pipeline exit ‚ùå
- 0 format classifications due to early pipeline exit ‚ùå
- 0 summary embeddings synced due to early pipeline exit ‚ùå

**Result**: Future large batch imports will automatically chunk vectors into 1,000-vector batches, preventing the error that caused pipeline failures.

### 16. Worker Dashboard Recovery Tools

**Task**: Restore missing worker UI sections that were removed to "reduce IOPS" but are needed for recovery operations

**Implementation**:
- Restored LLM Summary Worker section in `/app/dashboard/youtube/worker/page.tsx`
- Added Recovery Actions section with targeted recovery buttons:
  - "Generate Missing Summaries" - Triggers LLM summary backfill for recent imports
  - "Run Classifications" - Placeholder for classification worker triggers
- Restored missing state management and API integration:
  - `llmSummaryProgress` state with null safety checks
  - `fetchLlmSummaryProgress()` function 
  - Integration with existing `/api/workers/llm-summary/run` endpoint
- Fixed null pointer errors with proper fallback values for undefined properties

**Recovery Strategy for Failed Import**:
- **Immediate Action**: Use "Generate Missing Summaries" button to create summaries for 230 missing videos
- **Classification Recovery**: Connect classification button to existing worker endpoints to process 1,187 unclassified videos
- **Summary Embeddings**: Will be generated automatically after summaries are created

**Technical Details**:
- API endpoints still existed but UI was removed
- Restored with improved error handling and null safety
- Connected to existing job queue system for reliable processing
- Progress tracking and status monitoring included

**Result**: Users can now easily trigger recovery operations for failed import data through the restored worker dashboard interface.
