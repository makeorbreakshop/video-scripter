# Daily Development Log - August 15, 2025

## Summary
Fixed critical view tracking system issues and enhanced job cancellation functionality for better operational control.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. YouTube Quota Status API Fix
- **Time**: Morning
- **Task**: Fixed broken quota status endpoint preventing daily view tracking
- **Issue**: API calling non-existent `quotaTracker.getCurrentUsage()` method
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated API route to use correct `quotaTracker.getQuotaStatus()` method
  - Fixed property references to match `QuotaStatus` interface (`quota_used`, `quota_limit`, `quota_remaining`)
  - Added null safety with fallback values
- **Files Modified**: `/app/api/youtube/quota-status/route.ts`
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - View tracking system now operational

### 2. View Tracking Job Cancellation Enhancement
- **Time**: Morning  
- **Task**: Enhanced job cancellation to support both pending and processing jobs
- **Issue**: UI only allowed canceling "processing" jobs, but pending jobs also needed cancellation capability
- **Solution**:
  - **API Enhancement**: Modified `/api/view-tracking/cancel` POST method to accept both 'pending' and 'processing' statuses
  - **UI Enhancement**: Updated worker dashboard to show cancel buttons for both job types
  - **UX Improvement**: Enhanced confirmation dialog to show specific job status being cancelled
  - **Error Messages**: Improved error messaging for unsupported job statuses
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `/app/api/view-tracking/cancel/route.ts` - API logic update
  - `/app/dashboard/youtube/worker/page.tsx` - UI enhancement
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Users can now cancel stuck pending jobs from 8/15/2025

### 3. View Tracking Job Execution Threshold Removal
- **Time**: Morning
- **Task**: Fixed view tracking jobs getting stuck in pending state for large batches
- **Issue**: Jobs >800 API calls were set to 'pending' status waiting for non-existent worker process
- **Root Cause**: Code had 800 API call threshold where larger jobs would queue for worker processing, but no worker existed to process `type = 'view_tracking'` jobs
- **Solution**:
  - Removed arbitrary 800 API call threshold from `/api/view-tracking/run/route.ts`
  - All view tracking jobs now execute immediately regardless of size
  - Simplified execution path using existing 5-minute timeout protection
- **Impact**: Daily tracking with ~827 API calls now works properly instead of getting stuck
- **Files Modified**: `/app/api/view-tracking/run/route.ts`
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - View tracking jobs execute immediately for all batch sizes

## Next Steps
- Monitor view tracking system operation with all fixes in place
- Continue with scheduled view tracking operations
- Document threshold removal for future reference

## Notes
The quota status API fix enabled job creation, but the 800 API call threshold was causing larger jobs (like daily tracking with ~827 calls) to get stuck in pending status waiting for a worker that didn't exist. Yesterday it worked because the job was likely ≤800 calls and executed immediately. Removing the threshold restores the original simple execution model where all view tracking jobs run immediately with proper timeout protection.
