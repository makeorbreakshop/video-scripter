# Fix for Duplicate Export Files

## Summary of Changes

We've made the following changes to prevent duplicate export files and unnecessary worker jobs:

### 1. **Skip Worker Jobs for Fully Imported Channels**
- Modified `/app/api/video-import/unified/route.ts` to check if channels are already fully imported
- If a channel is marked as `is_fully_imported` in the `channel_import_status` table, no worker job is created
- Returns a "skipped" status instead of creating unnecessary jobs

### 2. **Disable Exports by Default**
- Updated `/app/api/youtube/import-competitor/route.ts` to set `skipExports: true`
- Updated `/app/api/youtube/daily-monitor/route.ts` to set `skipExports: true`
- This prevents creation of export files for routine imports

### 3. **How It Works**
When importing a competitor channel:
- System checks `channel_import_status` table
- If channel is already fully imported AND you're requesting "all" videos, it skips the job
- If channel needs updating (partial import or new videos), it proceeds
- No export files are created unless explicitly requested

## Impact
- No more duplicate export files cluttering the `/exports` directory
- Reduced unnecessary processing for already-imported channels
- Cleaner data management
- Your Pinecone and database remain clean (they already use upsert)

## What You Need to Know
- Your BERTopic analysis with 777 clusters is NOT affected by the duplicate exports
- The 1,940 unique topic combinations in your database are correct
- Pinecone has no duplicates (upsert prevents this)
- The centroid calculation script handles duplicates correctly by using a Map

## Next Steps
1. Run your centroid script: `node scripts/setup-centroids-complete.js`
2. Future imports won't create duplicate export files
3. You can safely delete old export files if needed (they're just backups)
