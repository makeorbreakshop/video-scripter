## ðŸ§ª Today's Work (2025-07-10)

### [1] Competitor Channel Summary Refresh - Missing Cron Job Discovery
- **Background**: User noticed some competitor channels showing "0 subscribers" on the manage channels page despite nightly refresh expectation
- **Investigation**: Discovered that while `refresh_competitor_channel_summary()` function exists, no cron job was scheduled to run it
- **Solution**: Created `/sql/add-competitor-refresh-cron.sql` with cron job scheduled for 3 AM daily
- **Implementation**: User ran SQL to create cron job (returned job ID 4), then manually refreshed data with `SELECT refresh_competitor_channel_summary();`

**Technical Details:**
- **Root Cause**: Missing cron job meant materialized view `competitor_channel_summary` wasn't being refreshed
- **Function Exists**: `refresh_competitor_channel_summary()` was properly implemented but never scheduled
- **Cron Schedule**: `'0 3 * * *'` - runs at 3 AM daily to refresh competitor channel statistics
- **Manual Fix**: Provided SQL command for immediate refresh: `SELECT refresh_competitor_channel_summary();`

**Impact:**
- Competitor channels now display accurate subscriber counts and thumbnails
- Automated nightly refresh ensures data stays current
- No more manual intervention needed for channel statistics updates

### [2] Missing Channel Stats Root Cause Investigation
- **Background**: After running manual refresh, many channels still showed 0 subscribers despite cron job running successfully
- **Investigation**: Discovered that videos imported on July 6th lack `channel_stats` metadata entirely
- **Root Cause**: Import process was updated between July 6 and July 8 to include channel statistics
- **Solution**: Created `scripts/update-missing-channel-stats.js` to backfill missing channel statistics from YouTube API

**Technical Details:**
- **Data Analysis**: Videos imported July 6th have null `channel_stats` in metadata
- **Working Data**: Videos imported July 8-9 have complete channel statistics
- **Materialized View**: Working correctly but returning 0 for missing source data
- **Fix Script**: Fetches channel data from YouTube API and updates all affected videos

**Script Features:**
- Identifies all channels with 0 subscribers in materialized view
- Fetches channel statistics from YouTube API in batches of 50
- Updates all videos for each channel with complete stats
- Automatically refreshes materialized view after updates
- Minimal API usage (1 unit per 50 channels)

**To Run:**
```bash
node scripts/update-missing-channel-stats.js
```

**Impact:**
- Will restore subscriber counts and thumbnails for all affected channels
- One-time fix for historical import issue
- Future imports already include this data automatically

## ðŸ“Š System Performance
- All existing performance metrics maintained from 2025-07-09
- Cron job discovery and fix completed without system impact
- Competitor channel summary now refreshing automatically

## ðŸŽ¯ Technical Achievements
- Identified missing cron job for competitor channel refresh
- Created and scheduled automated refresh job
- Fixed immediate data display issue with manual refresh

### [3] Database Documentation Update - Materialized Views and Cron Jobs
- **Background**: User requested investigation of database to document cron jobs and materialized views that support dashboard pages
- **Investigation**: Discovered 7 materialized views and 4 active cron jobs in the system
- **Action**: Updated `/docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` with comprehensive documentation

**Materialized Views Discovered:**
1. **analytics_stats** - Aggregated video/channel statistics (refreshed hourly)
2. **channel_network_centrality** - Channel discovery pattern analysis
3. **competitor_channel_summary** - Competitor channel aggregations (refreshed daily at 3 AM)
4. **mv_makeorbreak_dashboard** - Pre-calculated metrics for Make or Break Shop (300x performance improvement)
5. **packaging_performance** - Powers packaging analysis page (refreshed daily at 2 AM)
6. **unprocessed_thumbnails** - Tracks videos pending thumbnail embedding
7. **videos_2024_unprocessed** - 2024-specific unprocessed thumbnails

**Cron Jobs Documented:**
1. **baseline-processing** - Every 30 seconds - Processes baseline analytics in batches
2. **daily-packaging-refresh** - 2:00 AM daily - Refreshes packaging_performance materialized view
3. **refresh-analytics-stats** - Every hour - Updates analytics_stats view
4. **refresh-competitor-channels** - 3:00 AM daily - Updates competitor channel summary

**Documentation Updates:**
- Added new "Materialized Views for Dashboard Performance" section
- Added new "Scheduled Jobs (Cron)" section with all job details
- Enhanced "Custom Database Functions" section with refresh and dashboard support functions
- Updated summary with current counts: 7 materialized views, 4 cron jobs, 18+ functions

**Impact:**
- Complete visibility into automated database maintenance jobs
- Clear understanding of which views power which dashboard pages
- Documentation of refresh schedules and performance improvements
- Better maintenance and troubleshooting capability

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps
- Monitor cron job execution to ensure nightly refresh works properly
- Consider adding monitoring/alerting for cron job failures
- Run the channel stats update script when ready: `node scripts/update-missing-channel-stats.js`
