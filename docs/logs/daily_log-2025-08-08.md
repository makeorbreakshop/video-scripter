# Daily Log - 2025-08-08

## Session Timeline

- **Start Time**: ~9:00 AM
- **Session Focus**: UI Cleanup and Performance Distribution Removal

## Today's Progress

### 1. Removed Performance Distribution Section from Channel Pages

**Task**: Remove the Performance Distribution card from individual channel analysis pages

**Problem Identified**:
- Performance Distribution section showing video counts by performance tier (Under 0.5x, 0.5x-1.0x, etc.)
- User requested removal of this section from channel pages

**Implementation**:
- Removed entire Performance Distribution Card component from `/components/youtube/channel-analysis.tsx`
- Card previously displayed at lines 224-251
- Showed distribution across 4 performance tiers with color-coded counts

**Files Modified**:
- `/components/youtube/channel-analysis.tsx` - Removed lines 224-251 (Performance Distribution Card)

**Status**: ✅ Complete - Performance Distribution section removed from channel pages

**Impact**: Cleaner, more focused channel analysis page without redundant performance distribution metrics

## Session Summary

**Session Duration**: ~9:00 AM - ongoing

### Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Removed Performance Distribution section from channel analysis pages
2. ✅ Implemented automated temporal baseline recalculation system

### Technical Notes
- Simple UI cleanup task
- No backend changes required
- No data model impacts

### 2. Implemented Automated Temporal Baseline Recalculation System

**Task**: Create automated system to recalculate channel baselines as videos mature past 30-day mark

**Problem Identified**:
- Channel baselines need updating when new videos reach 30 days old
- Manual recalculation would be error-prone and inefficient
- Need automatic daily job to maintain accuracy

**Implementation**:

1. **Created SQL Functions**:
   - `get_recently_matured_videos()` - Identifies videos that recently passed 30-day threshold
   - `daily_baseline_update_smart()` - Recalculates baselines for affected channels only
   - Uses existing `calculate_video_channel_baseline()` function

2. **Smart Processing Logic**:
   - Only processes channels with NEW videos crossing 30-day mark
   - Checks for videos without baselines (not all 30-day old videos)
   - Recalculates all videos in affected channels for consistency
   - Updates temporal performance scores after baseline updates

3. **Automated Cron Job**:
   - Set up pg_cron job: `daily-temporal-baseline-update`
   - Runs daily at 10 AM UTC (3 AM PT)
   - Calls `daily_baseline_update_smart(30, 2)`
   - Processes videos that passed 30-day mark in last 2 days

**Testing Results**:
- Found 5 channels with newly matured videos
- Updated 1,311 video baselines across those channels
- Completed in 15.7 seconds
- System correctly identifies only NEW videos needing updates

**Files Created**:
- SQL functions added to Supabase database
- Cron job ID: 11

**Status**: ✅ Complete - Automated daily baseline updates now active

**Impact**: Channel baselines will automatically stay current as videos mature, ensuring temporal performance scores remain accurate without manual intervention. The system is efficient, only updating channels that actually need recalculation.

### 3. Complete Migration from Rolling Baselines to Temporal Baselines

**Task**: Replace old rolling baseline system with temporal baseline system throughout the entire import pipeline

**Problem Identified**:
- System was still calculating old `rolling_baseline_views` (simple 1-year average)
- Unified import process was calling old baseline processing function
- Two baseline systems running in parallel causing confusion
- 2,583 existing videos had no temporal baselines

**Implementation**:

1. **Updated INSERT Trigger**:
   - Modified `calculate_baseline_on_insert()` function
   - Now calculates `channel_baseline_at_publish` using last 10 videos approach
   - Calculates `temporal_performance_score` immediately on insert
   - Stopped calculating deprecated `rolling_baseline_views`

2. **Created New Processing Function**:
   - `trigger_temporal_baseline_processing()` replaces old function
   - Processes videos without temporal baselines
   - Updates temporal performance scores
   - Added SECURITY DEFINER for proper permissions

3. **Updated Unified Import Code**:
   - Modified `/lib/unified-video-import.ts`
   - Changed from `trigger_baseline_processing` to `trigger_temporal_baseline_processing`
   - Updated all log messages to reflect temporal baseline processing
   - Both regular and chunked processing now use temporal system

4. **Migrated Existing Videos**:
   - Processed 2,583 videos that lacked temporal baselines
   - Updated all videos to have proper temporal scores
   - Achieved 100% baseline coverage (175,651 videos)
   - 99.94% score coverage (only 103 edge cases)

5. **Disabled Old System**:
   - Removed hourly `baseline-processing` cron job
   - Old `rolling_baseline_views` field no longer calculated
   - System fully migrated to temporal baselines

**Testing Results**:
- Tested function on 10 videos successfully
- Verified baselines and scores calculating correctly
- Import messages now show "Triggering temporal baseline processing"
- All new imports automatically get temporal baselines

**Files Modified**:
- SQL function: `calculate_baseline_on_insert()`
- SQL function: `trigger_temporal_baseline_processing()`
- `/lib/unified-video-import.ts` - Updated to use temporal processing
- Disabled cron job ID: 7 (old baseline-processing)

**Status**: ✅ Complete - Full migration to temporal baselines

**Impact**: 
- More accurate performance scoring based on channel performance at time of publish
- Immediate temporal scoring on import (no delay)
- Simplified system with only one baseline approach
- All 175,651 regular videos now have temporal baselines
- Future imports automatically use temporal system
