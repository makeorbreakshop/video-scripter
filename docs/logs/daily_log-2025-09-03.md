## Search Functionality Fixes & Improvements

### 1. Fixed Broken Search API (`/app/api/search/unified/route.ts`)
   - **Issue**: ReferenceError - supabase was not defined
   - **Fix**: Called `getSupabase()` to get client instance (removed incorrect `await`)
   - **Learning**: `getSupabase()` returns client directly, not a promise

### 2. Resolved PostgreSQL Timeout Issues
   - **Issue**: ILIKE queries timing out on 240k+ videos after 8 seconds (error 57014)
   - **Analysis**: Despite 40 indexes on videos table, none supported text search
   - **Solution**: Switched to Pinecone for text search, which already contains titles and channel names
   - **Implementation**: Get 500 candidates from Pinecone, filter locally for keyword matches
   - **Result**: Search now takes 5-7 seconds consistently instead of timing out

### 3. Fixed UI "No Results" Loading State
   - **Issue**: "No results" message appeared while search was still processing
   - **Fix**: Added `queryTime !== null` check before showing no results
   - **Code**: `{!loading && !loadingMore && query && results.length === 0 && queryTime !== null && ...}`

### 4. Removed Tab Navigation from Search Interface
   - **Change**: Removed All/Videos/Channels/Similar tabs per user request
   - **Files Updated**: 
     - `/components/youtube/unified-search.tsx` - Removed Tabs import and UI
     - `/app/dashboard/youtube/analytics/page.tsx` - Simplified to show only unified search
   - **Result**: Cleaner, single search interface

### 5. Implemented Channel Search Operator
   - **Feature**: Added "channel:" operator for targeted channel searches
   - **Example**: `channel:i like to make stuff` searches for that specific channel
   - **Implementation**:
     - Fixed regex to capture full channel names: `/channel:(.+?)(?=\s+\w+:|$)/i`
     - Updated search to use dedicated `channels` table (4,622 records)
     - Modified logic to return only channels when channel operator is used
   - **Code Fix**: When `searchIntent.type === 'channel'`, skip video searches entirely

### 6. Database Discoveries
   - **Videos table**: 240k+ records with 40 indexes (none for text search)
   - **Channels table**: 4,622 records with proper indexing for fast lookups
   - **Pinecone**: Contains title, channel_name, and description text for all videos
   - **Decision**: Use Pinecone for text search, PostgreSQL for metadata lookups

### Technical Decisions
- Used existing infrastructure rather than creating new solutions
- Leveraged Pinecone's text storage for hybrid search approach
- Focused on targeted fixes rather than complete rewrites per user preference
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing API consumers

### Performance Metrics
- **Before**: Timeouts after 8 seconds for text searches
- **After**: Consistent 5-7 second response times
- **Channel searches**: Sub-second responses using dedicated table
