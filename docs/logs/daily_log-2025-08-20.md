# Daily Development Log - August 20, 2025

## Summary
Implemented channel-level institutional content filtering to prevent news and media organizations from appearing in content discovery features, creating a centralized channels table for improved data management.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Diagnosed Institutional Content Filtering Issue in Idea Heist
- **Time**: Morning
- **Task**: Investigate why news channels (NBC News, FOX, DW News) appear in Idea Heist discovery tool
- **Root Cause**: Videos from institutional channels not properly marked with `is_institutional = true`
- **Discovery**:
  - NBC News: 62 videos, 0 marked institutional
  - DW News: 59 videos, 0 marked institutional
  - ABC News: 131 videos, only 59 marked institutional
  - Total: 3,506 unique channels across system, but no central channel management
- **Status**: âœ… DIAGNOSED - Issue identified, solution planned

### 2. Created Centralized Channels Table Architecture
- **Time**: Morning
- **Task**: Design and implement single source of truth for channel data
- **Architecture Decision**: Create `channels` table instead of marking individual videos
- **Table Structure**:
  - Primary fields: channel_id, channel_name, channel_handle, thumbnail_url
  - Metrics: subscriber_count, view_count (from YouTube), video_count (calculated)
  - Management: is_institutional, is_owner, discovery_source
  - Tracking: first_seen_date, last_youtube_sync, metadata (JSONB)
- **Benefits**:
  - Eliminates duplicate channel data across 3,506 channels
  - Enables channel-level filtering and management
  - Prepares for future YouTube API enrichment (only 71 API calls for all channels)
- **Status**: âœ… DESIGNED - Schema finalized

### 3. Implemented Channels Table with Institutional Filtering
- **Time**: Late Morning
- **Task**: Execute database migration and integrate with existing systems
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Created channels table with comprehensive schema
  2. Added performance indexes (institutional, discovery_source, channel_name, subscriber_count)
  3. Populated from videos table (3,505 unique channels imported)
  4. Marked institutional channels based on existing video flags (10 channels identified)
  5. Created auto-update trigger for updated_at timestamp
  6. Updated RPC function `get_random_outlier_videos` to filter via channels table
- **Results**:
  - 3,505 total channels in system
  - 10 channels marked institutional (will expand as needed)
  - Idea Heist now filters using channel-level institutional status
- **Status**: âœ… COMPLETE - System operational with channel-level filtering

### 4. YouTube API Enrichment Planning
- **Time**: Afternoon
- **Task**: Analyze potential for enriching channel data via YouTube API
- **Available Data from YouTube channels.list API**:
  - **snippet**: description, customUrl, publishedAt, country, defaultLanguage
  - **statistics**: viewCount, subscriberCount, videoCount
  - **contentDetails**: uploads playlist ID
  - **brandingSettings**: keywords, banner images, channel tags
- **Cost Analysis**:
  - 1 quota unit per call (up to 50 channels per call)
  - 3,505 channels = 71 API calls = 71 units total
  - Less than 1% of daily 10,000 unit quota
  - Could enable daily subscriber tracking for all channels
- **Status**: ðŸ”„ PLANNED - Ready for implementation when needed

## Technical Details

### Channels Table Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE channels (
  channel_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  channel_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  channel_handle TEXT,
  thumbnail_url TEXT,
  subscriber_count INTEGER,
  view_count BIGINT,
  video_count INTEGER,
  description TEXT,
  country TEXT,
  published_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  is_institutional BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  is_owner BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  discovery_source TEXT,
  first_seen_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  last_youtube_sync TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Integration Points Updated
- **Idea Heist (Idea Radar)**: Now uses LEFT JOIN with channels table for institutional filtering
- **RPC Function**: `get_random_outlier_videos` updated to check `channels.is_institutional`
- **Future**: Video import process should maintain channels table automatically

### 5. Fixed Institutional Channel Marking and Filtering Issues
- **Time**: Afternoon
- **Task**: Debug and fix issues with Fox 11 Los Angeles persisting in Idea Heist despite marking attempts
- **Issue Discovered**: 
  - Fox 11 Los Angeles (`UCHfF8wFnipMeDpJf8OmMxDg`) had `is_institutional = false` in database
  - API endpoint had potential upsert logic issues that could fail silently
  - No verification step to confirm channels were actually marked
- **Solution Implemented**:
  1. **Enhanced `/api/admin/mark-institutional/route.ts`**:
     - Added explicit check for existing channel before upsert
     - Separated INSERT vs UPDATE logic for better error handling
     - Added verification query after marking to confirm success
     - Improved error messages with detailed failure reasons
     - Added console logging for debugging
  2. **API Testing Results**:
     - Successfully marked Fox 11 Los Angeles as institutional
     - Verified NBC News and other channels mark/unmark correctly
     - GET endpoint returns 13 institutional channels total
     - RPC function confirmed filtering Fox 11 videos (0 results)
- **Channels Now Marked as Institutional** (13 total):
  - ABC News, Associated Press, CNBC, FOX 11 Los Angeles
  - FOX 13 Seattle, NBC4 Washington, NBC News, and others
- **Status**: âœ… FIXED - Institutional filtering now working correctly

## Technical Implementation Details

### Updated Mark Institutional API Logic
```typescript
// Now checks if channel exists first
const { data: existingChannel } = await supabase
  .from('channels')
  .select('channel_id, channel_name, is_institutional')
  .eq('channel_id', channelId)
  .single();

if (existingChannel) {
  // UPDATE for existing channel
} else {
  // INSERT for new channel
}

// Verification step added
const { data: verifyChannel } = await supabase
  .from('channels')
  .select('channel_id, channel_name, is_institutional')
  .eq('channel_id', channelId)
  .single();
```

### Filtering Verification
- **RPC Function Test**: Confirmed `get_random_outlier_videos` excludes all institutional channels
- **Query Results**: 100 videos returned from 98 non-institutional channels (Fox 11 excluded)
- **Database State**: All marked channels have `is_institutional = true` with proper timestamps

## Next Steps
- Monitor Idea Heist to confirm news channels remain filtered
- Add more institutional channels as they're discovered
- Consider implementing YouTube API enrichment for full channel data
- Implement daily subscriber tracking system (71 units/day)
- Update video import process to maintain channels table

## Notes
The channels table provides a critical missing piece of infrastructure. Previously, channel information was scattered across 3,506+ unique channels in the videos.metadata JSONB field, making channel-level operations inefficient. The new centralized approach enables proper channel management, efficient filtering, and prepares for future features like subscriber tracking and channel analytics.

The institutional filtering solution is elegant - rather than marking thousands of individual videos, we mark channels at the source. This ensures new videos from institutional channels are automatically filtered, maintaining clean discovery results without manual intervention.

The fix to the marking API ensures reliable channel updates with proper verification, preventing the issue where channels appeared to be marked but weren't actually updated in the database.

### 6. Added Total Count Display to Idea Heist UI
- **Time**: Late Afternoon
- **Task**: Display total number of available results in Idea Heist interface
- **Implementation**:
  1. Added simple count display on filter bar line (not below)
  2. Shows format: "XXX results" (just total, no "showing X of Y")
  3. Updates dynamically when filters change
- **Status**: âœ… COMPLETE - Count displays on same line as filters

### 7. Fixed Channel ID Bug in API Response
- **Time**: Late Afternoon
- **Task**: Fix `channel_id: "undefined"` when marking channels as institutional
- **Issue**: `/api/idea-radar` endpoint wasn't including channel_id in response
- **Solution**: Added `channel_id` to OutlierVideo interface and response mapping
- **Result**: Channels now properly marked with actual IDs instead of undefined
- **Status**: âœ… FIXED - Channel marking now works correctly

### 8. Corrected Total Count to Include Institutional Filtering
- **Time**: Evening
- **Task**: Fix inaccurate total count in randomized mode (wasn't filtering institutional channels)
- **Issue**: Count query didn't JOIN with channels table, showing ~46,000+ instead of actual ~300
- **Solution Implemented**:
  1. Created new RPC function `get_random_outlier_videos_with_data` that:
     - Returns both videos AND accurate total count
     - Uses same LEFT JOIN for counting as for filtering
     - Ensures count matches what's actually available
  2. Updated API to use new function with fallback to old method
  3. Count now accurately reflects only non-institutional videos
- **Technical Details**:
  - Old: Count query on videos table only (no institutional filter)
  - New: Count includes LEFT JOIN with channels table WHERE `is_institutional = false OR NULL`
- **Status**: âœ… COMPLETE - Total count now accurate with institutional filtering

### 9. YouTube API Channel Data Enrichment Implementation
- **Time**: Late Evening
- **Task**: Enrich channels table with comprehensive YouTube metadata via API
- **Discovery Phase**:
  1. Tested YouTube channels.list API with MrBeast and I Like To Make Stuff
  2. Discovered wealth of available data not currently captured:
     - Custom URLs (@handles format)
     - Keywords for SEO/discovery
     - Topic IDs and categories (Wikipedia links)
     - Upload playlist IDs (critical for video fetching)
     - Language settings, COPPA compliance flags
     - Banner images, unsubscribed trailers
     - Localizations (20+ languages for some channels)

- **Database Schema Updates**:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE channels 
  ADD COLUMN custom_url TEXT,
  ADD COLUMN default_language VARCHAR(10),
  ADD COLUMN uploads_playlist_id TEXT,
  ADD COLUMN keywords TEXT,
  ADD COLUMN made_for_kids BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  ADD COLUMN hidden_subscriber_count BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  ADD COLUMN privacy_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'public';
  
  -- Added indexes for discovery and filtering
  CREATE INDEX idx_channels_keywords ON channels USING gin(to_tsvector('english', keywords));
  CREATE INDEX idx_channels_default_language ON channels(default_language);
  ```

- **Batch Enrichment Script Created** (`scripts/enrich-channels-batch.js`):
  - Processes 50 channels per API call (YouTube's maximum)
  - Efficiently handles 1,000 channels with just 20 API calls
  - Updates both direct columns and metadata JSONB
  - Stores topic IDs, banner URLs, localizations in metadata
  - Rate limiting with 1-second delays between batches
  - Dry-run mode for testing

- **Enrichment Results**:
  - Successfully enriched 1,000 channels needing updates
  - Total API cost: 20 units (0.2% of daily quota)
  - Data captured includes:
    - Custom URLs for all channels (@username format)
    - Keywords for discovery (e.g., "diy maker woodworking")
    - Topic categories (e.g., "Lifestyle", "Hobby", "Entertainment")
    - Upload playlist IDs for complete video fetching
    - COPPA compliance status (made_for_kids flag)
    - Privacy settings and subscriber visibility

- **Example Enriched Data**:
  - Drew Builds Stuff: Keywords "diy crafts creativity", Topics: Lifestyle/Hobby
  - Dylan McCool: Keywords "restored classic abandoned", Topics: Vehicle/Lifestyle
  - Mark Manson: Keywords "self-improvement life purpose", Topics: Knowledge/Health

- **Status**: âœ… COMPLETE - 1,000 channels enriched, system ready for remaining channels

### 10. Fixed Pagination Issue and Completed Full Channel Enrichment
- **Time**: Night
- **Task**: Fix Supabase 1000-row limit in enrichment script and complete full channel enrichment
- **Issue Discovered**: 
  - Initial script only fetched first 1,000 channels due to Supabase's default pagination limit
  - System had 3,506 total channels, leaving 1,506 channels unenriched
  
- **Solution Implemented**:
  1. **Updated `getChannelsToEnrich()` function** to handle pagination:
     - Added while loop to fetch channels in 1,000-row batches
     - Used `.range(offset, offset + pageSize - 1)` for proper pagination
     - Continues fetching until all channels retrieved or limit reached
  2. **Script now processes ALL channels** needing enrichment regardless of quantity

- **Final Enrichment Results**:
  - **3,504 channels successfully enriched** (99.94% success rate)
  - **Only 2 channels failed** due to invalid channel IDs:
    - "Make or Break Shop" - channel_id was channel name instead of YouTube ID
    - "undefined" - channel_id was literally "undefined" string
  - **All enriched channels** now have complete YouTube metadata
  
- **Database Statistics After Full Enrichment**:
  - Total channels: 3,506
  - Synced channels: 3,504
  - Never synced: 2 (invalid IDs)
  - Synced in last 7 days: 3,504
  - Needing refresh: 0

- **Verification Examples** - Random channels now have:
  - MakerThrive: Keywords "no-code nocode web design", Topics: Lifestyle/Technology/Knowledge
  - John Heisz: Keywords "woodworking jigs homemade tools", Upload playlist: UUjA8vRlL1c7BDixQRJ39-LQ
  - Everyday Home Repairs: Custom URL @everydayhomerepairs, Topics: Hobby/Lifestyle/Technology
  
- **Status**: âœ… COMPLETE - Full channel enrichment successful, 3,504/3,506 channels enriched

## Follow-up Fix - August 21, 2025

### 11. Fixed Idea Heist Performance and Missing Filters
- **Time**: Evening (August 21)
- **Task**: Resolve timeout issues and restore missing filters in `get_random_video_ids` SQL function
- **Issues Identified**:
  1. **Performance Issue**: Function used `random() < 0.15` in WHERE clause, forcing PostgreSQL to evaluate random() for all 45,000+ matching rows
  2. **Missing Filters**: Function lacked `is_short = false` and score cap filters present in original TypeScript code
  
- **Root Cause Analysis**:
  - With 45,000 rows matching (score > 1.5), the `random() < 0.15` approach caused 8+ second timeouts
  - PostgreSQL had to scan ALL rows and generate random numbers for each before filtering
  - YouTube Shorts were appearing because `is_short = false` filter was never added to SQL function
  - Extreme outliers (>100x) appeared due to missing score cap
  
- **Solution Implemented**:
  ```sql
  -- Replaced random() < 0.15 with ORDER BY random()
  -- Added missing is_short and score cap filters
  WHERE v.temporal_performance_score >= p_outlier_score
    AND v.temporal_performance_score <= 100  -- Added: Cap at 100x
    AND v.view_count >= p_min_views
    AND v.published_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day' * p_days_ago
    AND v.is_short = false  -- Added: Filter out YouTube Shorts
    AND v.channel_id NOT IN (
      SELECT channel_id FROM channels WHERE is_institutional = true
    )
  ORDER BY random()  -- Changed from random() < 0.15 in WHERE
  LIMIT p_sample_size;
  ```

- **Performance Improvement**:
  - **Before**: 8+ seconds (timeout) for large datasets
  - **After**: <500ms for all dataset sizes
  - Filters actually improve performance by reducing rows to sort
  
- **Results**:
  - No more YouTube Shorts in results
  - No extreme outliers (>100x performance)
  - Fast loading for all filter combinations including score > 1.5
  - Maintains true randomization while being performant
  
- **Status**: âœ… FIXED - Idea Heist now fast and properly filtered
