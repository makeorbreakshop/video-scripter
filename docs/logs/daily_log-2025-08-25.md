# Daily Development Log - August 25, 2025

## Session 1: YouTube Page Replica Analysis - Playwright Reconnaissance

### Summary
Completed comprehensive analysis of YouTube channel page structure using Playwright automation to inform development of exact YouTube replica for thumbnail mockup functionality.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Multi-Channel Analysis
- **MKBHD Channel**: Desktop (1920×1080), tablet (768×1024), mobile (375×667) screenshots
- **Rasmic Channel**: Light/dark mode analysis, panel vs grid layout comparison
- **Measurements Captured**: 305×248px video cards, 4-column desktop grid, 16:9 thumbnails
- **Component Mapping**: `ytd-rich-item-renderer` hierarchy, responsive breakpoints

#### 2. Technical Documentation
**Created comprehensive analysis report** (`/docs/youtube-page-replica-analysis.md`):
- Exact measurements and CSS specifications for implementation
- Light/dark mode color schemes with CSS custom properties
- Component architecture recommendations with TypeScript interfaces
- Implementation roadmap for mockup tool development

### Key Findings
- **Desktop Grid**: 1,284px container, 4 columns, 305×172px thumbnails (16:9)
- **Theme Variables**: Complete light (#FFFFFF bg, #0F0F0F text) / dark (#0F0F0F bg, #FFFFFF text) specifications
- **Layout Types**: Grid layout (Videos tab) optimal for mockup tool vs panel layout (Home tab) complexity
- **Implementation Ready**: All measurements and design tokens documented for pixel-perfect replica

### Status
✅ Playwright reconnaissance phase complete with 8 screenshots captured
✅ Comprehensive technical documentation created (2,500+ words)
✅ Implementation specifications ready for component development phase
✅ Integration points identified with existing video-scripter architecture

### Files Modified
- `/docs/youtube-page-replica-analysis.md` - Complete technical specification document

## Session 2: Daily Log Management - August 24th Condensation

### Summary
Condensed the 599-line August 24th daily log into a concise entry and updated the condensed development log for better project documentation management.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Log Condensation
**Source**: `/docs/logs/daily_log-2025-08-24.md` (599 lines, 6 sessions)
**Target**: `/docs/logs/archive_logs/condensed-dev-log.md`

**Condensation Results**:
- Reduced from 599 lines to 5 bullet points (99% reduction)
- Preserved core technical achievement: YouTube Player API → iframe solution
- Maintained development narrative continuity

#### 2. Condensed Entry Added
**Entry 27: YouTube Player API Complete Overhaul**
- Multiple failed debugging attempts with YouTube Player API timing issues
- Root causes: CSS interference, React state timing, callback complexity  
- Solution: Direct iframe embedding with optimized parameters
- Results: 90% code reduction, instant reliable playback, zero console errors

### Status
✅ August 24th daily log successfully condensed and archived
✅ Condensed development log updated with entry #27
✅ Documentation continuity maintained for historical reference
✅ Current daily logging process established

### Files Modified
- `/docs/logs/archive_logs/condensed-dev-log.md` - Added entry #27
- `/docs/logs/daily_log-2025-08-25.md` - Created (this file)
