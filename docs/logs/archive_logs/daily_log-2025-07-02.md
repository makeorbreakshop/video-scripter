# Video Scripter â€” Working Dev Log (2025-07-02)
- This gets refreshed daily and the core info is saved to condensed logs
- Goal is to give Claude good active context for what we are working on

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Video Scripter is a Next.js 15 application for analyzing YouTube videos and creating content using AI. Features comprehensive video analysis pipeline with the "Skyscraper" framework, vector database integration, and multi-phase workflow for content creation.

## [1] Competitor Video Integration in Packaging Analysis

**âœ… Implemented competitor filtering system for packaging analysis:**
- Added "Video Source" filter with options: My Videos Only / Competitors Only / All Videos
- Channel-specific baselines: competitors use their own channel averages for fair comparison
- Visual indicators: blue "Competitor" badges, channel names, different baseline labels
- Updated API to handle both personal + competitor videos with proper thumbnail fallbacks

**ðŸ”§ Technical changes:**
- Enhanced `usePackagingFilters` hook with `competitorFilter` state
- Modified `/api/youtube/packaging` to query videos table directly with `is_competitor` filtering
- Updated `PackagingCard` component with competitor badges and channel info display
- Fixed thumbnail errors by generating YouTube URLs for personal videos missing thumbnails

**ðŸ“Š Current competitor data status:**
- I Like To Make Stuff: 42 videos, 113K avg views baseline
- Make Something: 33 videos, 70K avg views baseline  
- Witt Works: 8 videos, 554K avg views baseline

Ready for analyzing competitor packaging strategies with fair channel-specific performance comparisons.

## [2] Enhanced Competitor Import System

**âœ… Added comprehensive import options and preview functionality:**
- "All Time" option for importing entire channel history (no date restrictions)
- "All videos" option for unlimited import count (up to 500 max for API limits)
- Shorts filtering checkbox to exclude videos under 60 seconds
- Channel preview stats showing estimated import count based on current filters
- Real-time preview updates when changing time period, video limits, or shorts filtering

**ðŸ”§ Technical implementation:**
- New `/api/youtube/channel-preview-stats` endpoint for estimating import counts
- Enhanced competitor import UI with dynamic preview stats display
- Updated `/api/youtube/import-competitor` to handle all-time imports and shorts filtering
- Added duration parsing for YouTube ISO 8601 format (PT1M30S) to filter shorts
- Improved error handling with proper TypeScript error casting

**ðŸ“Š New import capabilities:**
- Time periods: 30 days / 90 days / 6 months / 1 year / All time
- Video limits: 25 / 50 / 100 / 200 / 500 / All videos  
- Content filtering: Option to exclude YouTube Shorts (under 60 seconds)
- Preview shows total channel videos vs estimated import count based on filters

## [3] Research Channel Expansion Strategy

**âœ… Implemented research channel baseline expansion system:**
- Built API endpoint for importing historical videos from 107+ research channels
- Manual channel ID mapping system to avoid expensive YouTube search API costs (saves 100+ units per channel)
- Time-based filtering (3 months / 6 months / 1 year / 2 years / all time) for targeted imports
- Preview functionality shows video counts, existing vs new videos, and API costs before importing
- Efficient PlaylistItems API approach (3-8 units) vs expensive Search API (100+ units)

**ðŸŽ¯ Dynamic Performance Ratio Strategy:**
- **Problem**: Fixed baselines become outdated as YouTube algorithm changes and channel performance evolves
- **Solution**: Calculate performance ratios dynamically at query time using rolling 12-month baseline
- **Approach**: Import ALL videos for complete thumbnail/title inspiration, but calculate "current winners" using only recent performance data
- **Benefits**: 
  - Performance ratios automatically stay current as time passes
  - One database with infinite filtering flexibility (current winners vs inspiration browsing)
  - Scales to thousands of videos without manual baseline recalculation
  - Future-proof as strategies evolve over time

**ðŸ”§ Technical implementation planned:**
- Store raw view counts and publish dates for all imported videos
- Calculate channel baselines dynamically using last 12 months of videos at query time
- Filter options: "current winners" (high ratio + recent), "inspiration browsing" (all videos), date ranges
- Manual channel ID mappings: Fix This Build That (UCHYSw4XKO_q1GaChw5pxa-w) - more to be added as needed

**ðŸ“Š Research expansion goals:**
- Target: 107 research channels with 1-5 videos each needing historical expansion
- Create proper baselines for packaging analysis using last year's worth of content
- Exclude already-expanded channels (I Like To Make Stuff, Make Something, wittworks)
- Scale to thousands of videos across hundreds of channels for comprehensive analysis

## [4] Research Channel Expansion System Implementation & Database Fixes

**âœ… Successfully implemented and tested research channel expansion:**
- Fixed UUID validation errors in database constraints (`user_id` and `imported_by` fields require proper UUID format)
- Fixed data source constraint violation (database only accepts `'owner'` or `'competitor'` values)
- Updated research channel import to use `data_source: 'competitor'` and `is_competitor: true`
- Successfully tested with Fix This Build That: imported 177 new videos from 200 total (excluding 22 shorts)

**ðŸ”§ Technical fixes applied:**
- Converted test user ID from `"test-user"` string to proper UUID format `"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"`
- Updated both `user_id` and `imported_by` fields to handle UUID constraints
- Changed `data_source` from `'research_expansion'` to `'competitor'` to match database check constraint
- Removed time period filtering to import entire channel backlog as planned

**ðŸ“Š Research expansion test results:**
- Fix This Build That: 200 videos found, 178 after filtering shorts, 177 new imports, 1 already existed
- Channel average views: 1,183,943 (calculated from complete dataset)
- API efficiency: 3-8 units using manual channel ID vs 103-108 with search

## [5] Enhanced Individual Channel Refresh System

**âœ… Implemented comprehensive channel refresh functionality:**
- Built `/api/youtube/refresh-competitor-channel` endpoint for updating existing competitor channels
- Enhanced refresh system to update ALL video metrics (views, likes, comments) with current YouTube data
- Added channel-level statistics updates including current subscriber counts and channel metadata
- Integrated refresh buttons in competitor management UI with real-time loading states

**ðŸ”„ Complete refresh capabilities:**
- **Video Updates**: Refreshes view counts, like counts, comment counts for ALL existing videos
- **Channel Stats**: Updates subscriber count, total video count, channel thumbnail
- **Performance Ratios**: Recalculates baselines using complete current dataset
- **New Videos**: Imports any videos published since last refresh
- **Shorts Filtering**: Automatically excludes videos under 60 seconds

**ðŸ”§ Technical implementation:**
- Enhanced API to fetch channel statistics (`part=contentDetails,statistics,snippet`)
- Implemented dual-path logic: insert new videos + update existing videos
- Added channel metadata storage in video records for current subscriber/view counts
- Updated UI with individual refresh buttons, loading states, and success notifications

**ðŸ“ˆ Refresh system benefits:**
- **Current Data**: All metrics reflect real-time YouTube performance
- **Fresh Baselines**: Performance ratios calculated with up-to-date view averages
- **Complete Coverage**: Updates entire channel backlog in one operation
- **Efficient API Usage**: Single channel stats call + video details (3-8 units total)

**ðŸŽ¯ Ready for production use:**
- Individual refresh buttons for I Like To Make Stuff, Make Something, and wittworks
- Real-time progress indicators and success/error messaging
- Comprehensive metric updates ensuring competitive analysis accuracy

## [6] Channel Display & Authentication System Fixes

**âœ… Fixed competitor channel visibility and authentication issues:**
- Resolved Scott Yu-Jan channel (33 videos) not appearing in competitor dashboard despite successful import
- Identified and fixed Row Level Security (RLS) policy conflicts blocking client-side data access
- Created `/api/youtube/competitor-channels` endpoint using service role to bypass RLS restrictions
- Removed unnecessary authentication dependencies from competitors page (dev tool doesn't need user auth)

**ðŸ”§ Technical fixes applied:**
- Built server-side API endpoint with Supabase service role for unrestricted database access
- Updated competitors page to use API endpoint instead of direct client-side Supabase queries
- Removed `currentUser` dependencies and authentication checks from competitor management UI
- Fixed hydration mismatch errors by adding client-side mount guards and consistent date formatting

**ðŸ“Š Research channel expansion system refinements:**
- Enhanced `/api/youtube/channel-statuses` to properly return channel IDs and video counts from tracking table
- Updated ResearchChannelExpansion component to auto-populate channel IDs and show verification status
- Added channel ID badges and "No ID" indicators for channels missing YouTube channel IDs
- Simplified API responses to directly show expansion-ready channels with proper metadata

**âœ… System now fully functional:**
- All imported competitor channels (Scott Yu-Jan, Make Something, Fix This Build That, etc.) properly visible
- Research channel expansion page shows correct video counts and channel IDs
- No authentication barriers for development workflow
- Clean, fast loading without hydration errors

## [7] Research Channel Expansion Filtering Fix

**âœ… Fixed expansion dropdown filtering to use proper import tracking:**
- **Problem**: Make With Miles and Practical Engineering were still showing in research expansion dropdown despite being fully imported (63 and 194 videos respectively)
- **Root Cause**: System was filtering by video count (<50) instead of using the proper `is_fully_imported` flag from `channel_import_status` table
- **Solution**: Updated `/api/youtube/channel-statuses` to filter by `is_fully_imported` flag instead of arbitrary video count

**ðŸ”§ Technical changes:**
- Modified filtering logic from `actualCount < 50` to `!status.is_fully_imported` 
- Updated research expansion endpoint to always mark channels as `is_fully_imported: true` after successful import
- Fixed Make With Miles and Practical Engineering status in database to mark them as fully imported
- Expansion dropdown now correctly excludes: Fix This Build That, I Like To Make Stuff, Make Something, wittworks, Make With Miles, Practical Engineering

**ðŸ“Š Current system behavior:**
- Research expansion dropdown only shows channels that haven't been fully imported via the expansion system
- Channels imported via regular competitor import are properly tracked when later processed through research expansion
- `first_import_date` timestamp properly set for all fully imported channels
- System respects the intended workflow: only show channels that need historical backlog expansion

## [8] Packaging Performance Optimization & Database Function Implementation

**âœ… Massive performance optimization for packaging analysis filtering:**
- **Problem**: Filtering operations were extremely slow (2-5 seconds) due to N+1 query problem - making separate database calls for each channel baseline calculation
- **Root Cause**: Client-side approach was making 10-50+ separate database queries for performance ratio calculations
- **Solution**: Created PostgreSQL database function `get_packaging_performance()` that handles all calculations server-side in a single optimized query

**ðŸš€ Database function implementation:**
- Built comprehensive PostgreSQL function with dynamic filtering, sorting, and pagination
- Single query with CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for efficient baseline calculations
- Server-side performance ratio calculations using rolling 12-month channel averages
- Proper SQL injection protection with parameterized inputs
- Leverages existing database indexes on `channel_id`, `published_at`, and `view_count`

**ðŸ”§ Technical improvements:**
- Updated `/api/youtube/packaging` to use single `supabase.rpc('get_packaging_performance')` call
- Eliminated multiple parallel database queries and client-side performance calculations
- Added proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Maintained existing API interface for seamless frontend compatibility
- Enhanced logging with query timing metrics

**ðŸ“ˆ Performance results:**
- **Filter operations**: From 2-5 seconds â†’ < 100ms (95%+ improvement)
- **Database queries**: From 10-50+ queries â†’ 1 single function call
- **Memory usage**: Dramatically reduced by eliminating client-side calculations
- **Network traffic**: Minimal - single request/response cycle
- **Scalability**: Now handles thousands of videos efficiently

**âœ… Follows Supabase best practices:**
- Database functions for complex business logic
- Server-side calculations leveraging PostgreSQL power
- Single RPC call instead of multiple client queries
- Efficient use of existing database indexes
- Proper security with `SECURITY DEFINER` function permissions

## [9] Enhanced Shorts Filtering & UI Optimization

**âœ… Improved shorts detection and filtering system:**
- **Problem**: YouTube Shorts were still appearing in packaging analysis despite duration-based filtering (90 seconds)
- **Root Cause**: Some shorts are 1+ minutes but vertical format, and duration-only filtering missed content-based indicators
- **Solution**: Enhanced database function with multi-layered shorts detection using duration + content analysis

**ðŸ”§ Enhanced shorts filtering implementation:**
- **Duration-based filtering**: Videos under 90 seconds (PT1M30S and shorter)
- **Content-based filtering**: Videos with `#shorts` hashtag in title or description
- **Metadata filtering**: Videos with `shorts` in tags array
- **Baseline exclusion**: Shorts excluded from both results AND channel baseline calculations for accurate performance ratios

**ðŸ“Š Filtering results:**
- **Before enhanced filtering**: 3,580 videos â†’ 3,286 videos (294 shorts filtered by duration)
- **After content filtering**: 3,286 videos â†’ 3,244 videos (42 additional shorts filtered by hashtags)
- **Total shorts filtered**: 336 videos removed from packaging analysis

**ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX improvements for better thumbnail visibility:**
- **Removed competitor badges**: Eliminated blue "Competitor" overlay badges that were covering thumbnail content
- **Compact filter bar**: Redesigned from 2-3 row layout to single horizontal row (reduced from ~100px to ~40px height)
- **Optimized filter controls**: Shortened labels ("Views" vs "View Count"), compact widths, joined sort controls
- **Better card layout**: Maintained 3-column grid but with more vertical space for larger thumbnail visibility

**ðŸ”§ Technical UI changes:**
- Updated `PackagingCard` component to remove competitor badge overlays
- Redesigned `PackagingFilters` component with single-row flex layout and compact controls
- Enhanced `get_packaging_performance()` database function with comprehensive shorts filtering
- Maintained all filtering functionality while reducing horizontal space usage by 60%

**ðŸ“ˆ User experience improvements:**
- **Cleaner thumbnails**: No overlay badges blocking thumbnail content
- **More screen space**: Filter bar uses 60% less vertical space
- **Faster scanning**: Larger, unobstructed thumbnails for better pattern recognition
- **Professional appearance**: Compact, organized filter controls with consistent sizing

## [10] Critical Filter System Bug Fixes & Performance Badge Improvements

**âœ… Fixed major filter system breakdown that prevented videos from loading:**
- **Problem**: Filter value mismatch between frontend and database caused complete system failure
- **Root Cause**: Database function expected `'exceptional'`, `'above_average'`, `'below_average'` but frontend sent `'excellent'`, `'good'`, `'average'`
- **Impact**: All user videos disappeared from packaging analysis (0 results returned)
- **Solution**: Updated database function to use consistent frontend filter values

**ðŸ”§ Database function filter alignment:**
- Fixed performance filter mappings in `get_packaging_performance()` function
- Changed `'exceptional'` â†’ `'excellent'` (2.0x+ performance)
- Changed `'above_average'` â†’ `'good'` (1.0-2.0x performance)  
- Changed `'below_average'` â†’ `'average'` (0.5-1.0x performance)
- Maintained `'poor'` filter for <0.5x performance

**ðŸš¨ Null duration handling fix:**
- **Critical Issue**: 176 of 208 user videos had `duration: null`, causing shorts filter to exclude ALL user content
- **Solution**: Modified shorts filtering logic to only apply duration checks when `duration IS NOT NULL`
- **Approach**: Content-based filtering (hashtags) applied first, duration filtering only as secondary check
- **Result**: User videos with null durations now properly included in results

**ðŸŽ¨ Performance badge display improvements:**
- Fixed broken badge logic that made all videos show as "average" regardless of actual performance
- Updated badge conditions: Excellent (â‰¥2.0x), Good (1.0-2.0x), Average (0.5-1.0x), Poor (<0.5x)
- Changed display format from "+2.50" to "2.5x" for clearer performance indication
- Added blue color for "good" performance tier between green (excellent) and yellow (average)

**ðŸ“Š UI enhancements for better readability:**
- Increased filter control widths: Performance (28pxâ†’36px), Sort (28pxâ†’32px), Source (24pxâ†’28px), Date (20pxâ†’24px)
- Enhanced card content: larger title text (text-smâ†’text-base), bigger icons (h-3â†’h-4), bolder view counts
- Improved baseline comparison layout with cleaner "vs Channel Avg" / "vs Baseline" display
- Enhanced competitor channel styling with blue background highlight

**âœ… System now fully operational:**
- All 208 user videos properly loading and displaying
- High-performance videos (2.0x+) now accessible via "Excellent" filter
- Performance badges accurately reflect video performance ratios
- Shorts filtering working correctly while preserving user content with missing duration data
- Filter controls more readable and properly labeled with performance ranges
