# Daily Development Log - August 15, 2025

## Summary
Fixed critical view tracking system issues and enhanced job cancellation functionality for better operational control.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. YouTube Quota Status API Fix
- **Time**: Morning
- **Task**: Fixed broken quota status endpoint preventing daily view tracking
- **Issue**: API calling non-existent `quotaTracker.getCurrentUsage()` method
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated API route to use correct `quotaTracker.getQuotaStatus()` method
  - Fixed property references to match `QuotaStatus` interface (`quota_used`, `quota_limit`, `quota_remaining`)
  - Added null safety with fallback values
- **Files Modified**: `/app/api/youtube/quota-status/route.ts`
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - View tracking system now operational

### 2. View Tracking Job Cancellation Enhancement
- **Time**: Morning  
- **Task**: Enhanced job cancellation to support both pending and processing jobs
- **Issue**: UI only allowed canceling "processing" jobs, but pending jobs also needed cancellation capability
- **Solution**:
  - **API Enhancement**: Modified `/api/view-tracking/cancel` POST method to accept both 'pending' and 'processing' statuses
  - **UI Enhancement**: Updated worker dashboard to show cancel buttons for both job types
  - **UX Improvement**: Enhanced confirmation dialog to show specific job status being cancelled
  - **Error Messages**: Improved error messaging for unsupported job statuses
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `/app/api/view-tracking/cancel/route.ts` - API logic update
  - `/app/dashboard/youtube/worker/page.tsx` - UI enhancement
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Users can now cancel stuck pending jobs from 8/15/2025

### 3. View Tracking Job Execution Threshold Removal
- **Time**: Morning
- **Task**: Fixed view tracking jobs getting stuck in pending state for large batches
- **Issue**: Jobs >800 API calls were set to 'pending' status waiting for non-existent worker process
- **Root Cause**: Code had 800 API call threshold where larger jobs would queue for worker processing, but no worker existed to process `type = 'view_tracking'` jobs
- **Solution**:
  - Removed arbitrary 800 API call threshold from `/api/view-tracking/run/route.ts`
  - All view tracking jobs now execute immediately regardless of size
  - Simplified execution path using existing 5-minute timeout protection
- **Impact**: Daily tracking with ~827 API calls now works properly instead of getting stuck
- **Files Modified**: `/app/api/view-tracking/run/route.ts`
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - View tracking jobs execute immediately for all batch sizes

### 4. Idea Heist Discovery Tool Enhancement
- **Time**: Afternoon
- **Task**: Enhanced Idea Heist tool with better randomization and view filtering capabilities
- **Issues**: 
  - Poor randomization (only 500-video pool from 49K+ dataset)
  - Missing view count filtering options
  - Performance scores above 100x causing data quality issues
- **Solutions**:
  - **Performance Cap**: Added 100x maximum score limit to prevent outlier data errors
  - **View Filter**: Added 6-tier view filter (100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000, 1,000,000, 10,000,000)
  - **Better Randomization**: Replaced 500-video pool with 3x sample size + Fisher-Yates shuffle for true coverage
  - **UI Enhancement**: Added "Min Views" dropdown with proper comma formatting and descending order
  - **Default Settings**: Set 10,000+ views as default threshold for broader discovery
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/app/api/idea-radar/route.ts` - API logic, validation, and randomization
  - `/public/idea-heist-3step.html` - Frontend UI and event handling
- **API Validation**: Tested all view thresholds, randomization, and error handling
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Users can now discover from full 49K+ video dataset with proper filtering

### 5. Idea Heist Pure Random Mode Implementation
- **Time**: Evening
- **Task**: Converted Idea Heist to pure serendipitous discovery mode
- **Issue**: User wanted true serendipity, not "best first" sorting option
- **Solution**:
  - Removed "Best First" vs "Random" toggle button from UI
  - Set `isRandomMode = true` permanently for pure random discovery
  - Always uses `randomize: 'true'` in API calls
  - Removed `toggleSortMode()` function entirely
  - Simplified debug logging to always show "RANDOM" mode
- **Files Modified**: `/public/idea-heist-3step.html` - UI simplification and mode enforcement
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Tool now provides pure serendipitous discovery experience

### 6. Idea Heist Random Sampling Bias Fix
- **Time**: Evening (continued)
- **Task**: Fixed random mode showing only high-performance videos despite 3x minimum filter
- **Issue**: Random mode was returning videos with 10x+ scores instead of expected distribution starting from 3x threshold
- **Root Cause**: Supabase query without explicit ordering was implicitly favoring high-performance videos (likely due to database indexes)
- **Solution**:
  - Added `.order('id')` to random query to ensure neutral sampling before Fisher-Yates shuffle
  - This prevents implicit performance-based ordering that was skewing results toward higher scores
  - Random selection now properly respects user filters while providing true distribution within those bounds
- **Files Modified**: `/app/api/idea-radar/route.ts` - Added explicit ordering to random query
- **Impact**: Users now see proper score distribution starting from their minimum threshold (e.g., 3x, 4x, 5x) mixed with higher performers
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Random discovery now shows true performance distribution within user-specified filters

## Next Steps
- Monitor view tracking system operation with all fixes in place
- Continue with scheduled view tracking operations
- Document threshold removal for future reference
- Monitor Idea Heist tool usage with new filtering capabilities

## Notes
The quota status API fix enabled job creation, but the 800 API call threshold was causing larger jobs (like daily tracking with ~827 calls) to get stuck in pending status waiting for a worker that didn't exist. Yesterday it worked because the job was likely ≤800 calls and executed immediately. Removing the threshold restores the original simple execution model where all view tracking jobs run immediately with proper timeout protection.

The Idea Heist enhancement addresses a critical discovery limitation where users were only seeing 1% of available viral content due to poor randomization. Now users can explore the full dataset (49K+ qualifying videos) with proper view-tier filtering for different viral scales.
