## Session 3 - Morning

- **Time**: Morning session continuation
- **Focus**: Simplifying Video Grouping to MVP

## Major Accomplishments

### [3] Refined Video Grouping to Minimal Viable Product

1. **Task**: Strip down complex grouping system to testable MVP
2. **Context**: User correctly identified the initial design was overly complicated

3. **MVP Design - Phase 1**:
   - **Core Feature**: Save searches as reusable collections
   - **Implementation**: Add "Save this search" button to existing video-explorer
   - **User Flow**: Search → View results → Save as named group → Access later
   - **Example**: Search "morning routine" → Save as "Morning routine examples"

4. **Phase 2 (If Phase 1 Proves Valuable)**:
   - **Feature**: Show what videos in a group have in common
   - **Basic Stats**: Average views, common formats, average length, common title words
   - **No Complex AI**: Just surface-level patterns

5. **Phase 3 (If Phase 2 Shows Promise)**:
   - **Feature**: Performance tracking for content created using groups
   - **Metric**: "3 videos created using this group. Average: 156% of channel average"
   - **Validation**: Each feature proves the next is worth building

6. **Why This Approach Works**:
   - Immediate value with minimal development
   - User behavior validates concept before complex features
   - Natural progression from simple to sophisticated
   - Each phase provides standalone value

*Session Status: MVP approach defined, ready for implementation*

4. **Path Forward**: Start simple (saved searches) and evolve based on usage

### Video Grouping System Benefits
- **Immediate**: Reusable research collections
- **Near-term**: Pattern recognition across grouped videos
- **Long-term**: AI collaborator that understands content success patterns

### Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1 MVP**: Saved searches with names
- **Success Metric**: Do users create and reuse saved groups?
- **Evolution Path**: Add intelligence only after proving base value
- **Risk Mitigation**: Each phase works standalone without future phases

## Next Steps

1. Implement "Save Search" functionality in video-explorer
2. Track usage metrics for saved searches
3. If adopted, add basic pattern analysis
4. Consider visual grouping interface if patterns prove valuable
5. Build toward intelligent content synthesis

## Technical Considerations

### For MVP Implementation
- Add `saved_searches` table with user_id, name, query, created_at
- Modify video-explorer UI to show saved searches
- Add save button to search results
- Track click-through rates on saved searches

### Future Considerations
- Group composition tracking (which videos, when added)
- Performance correlation analysis
- Cross-group pattern detection
- Visual relationship mapping

## Learning & Insights

- **Simplicity First**: Complex systems need simple foundations
- **User Validation**: Let usage guide feature development
- **Incremental Value**: Each phase should provide immediate benefit
- **Database Leverage**: Focus on making existing data more actionable
- **Context Persistence**: Key differentiator for content intelligence

---

## Session Summary

Today's focus on content intelligence revealed that while sophisticated systems like Poppy AI provide inspiration, the path to leveraging our video database starts with simple, validated features. The MVP approach of saved searches provides immediate value while laying groundwork for more intelligent features if user behavior warrants them.

The key insight is that our massive database becomes valuable not through complex algorithms alone, but through tools that help creators build and maintain context over time. Starting with saved searches and evolving based on real usage ensures we build what creators actually need.

## Session 4 - Afternoon

- **Time**: Afternoon session
- **Focus**: Fixing View Tracking Query Limits

## Major Accomplishments

### [4] Fixed View Tracking Service to Handle Large Tier Quotas

1. **Task**: Fix view tracking system that was only processing 6,000 videos instead of planned 100,000
2. **Context**: User discovered daily tracking was limited to 1,000 videos per tier despite calculating correct quotas

3. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - System correctly calculated tier quotas (25,000 for Tier 1, 20,000 for Tier 2, etc.)
   - Supabase has a default query limit of 1,000 rows
   - Single `.limit(limit)` query was capping each tier at 1,000 videos
   - Result: Only 6,000 total videos tracked (1,000 × 6 tiers)

4. **Solution Implemented**:
   - Modified `/lib/view-tracking-service.ts` to fetch videos in chunks
   - Implemented pagination using `.range()` instead of `.limit()`
   - Each tier now fetches multiple 1,000-row chunks until quota is reached
   
5. **Technical Details**:
   ```typescript
   // Old approach (limited to 1000)
   .limit(limit)
   
   // New approach (fetches in chunks)
   while (tierVideos.length < limit) {
     const chunk = await supabase
       .from('view_tracking_priority')
       .select(...)
       .range(offset, offset + chunkSize - 1);
     tierVideos.push(...chunk);
     offset += chunk.length;
   }
   ```

6. **Impact**:
   - Daily tracking now properly handles 100,000 videos (2,000 API calls × 50 videos/call)
   - Tier 1: 25,000 videos (25 queries)
   - Tier 2: 20,000 videos (20 queries)
   - All tiers now receive their full quota allocation

7. **Important Notes**:
   - System still respects tier scheduling (only tracks videos due for update)
   - For initial bootstrapping, use "Update All" button which ignores schedules
   - Tier system designed for ongoing maintenance, not initial population

*Session Status: View tracking query limits fixed, ready for full-scale tracking*

## Session 6 - Afternoon

- **Time**: Afternoon session continuation
- **Focus**: Designing Age-Adjusted Performance Scoring System

## Strategic Planning

### [6] Conceptualized Channel-Specific Growth Curve Modeling

1. **Problem Statement**: Current performance score (views / yearly average) penalizes new videos
   - 3-day old video with 10K views scores 0.1 (looks terrible)
   - But that video is actually performing exceptionally for its age

2. **Solution Approach**: Build channel-specific growth curves from view tracking data
   
3. **Key Insights Developed**:
   
   **a) Age-Adjusted Performance Score**
   - Compare videos at the same age, not absolute views
   - Formula: `Current Views / Channel's Median Views at Same Age`
   - Score > 1.0 = Outperforming, Score < 1.0 = Underperforming
   
   **b) Channel Growth Curve Modeling**
   - Normalize all videos to early snapshot = 100%
   - Plot (age, % growth) points across all channel videos
   - Fit curve: `Expected_Views = Early_Views * growth_function(age)`
   - Each channel gets unique growth formula
   
   **c) Performance-Based Comparisons**
   - Use channel's actual average views, not subscriber count
   - Subscriber counts often meaningless (dead subs vs engaged audience)
   - Channel baseline = median views of recent videos
   
   **d) Time-Weighted Adaptations**
   - Recent videos weighted more heavily in model
   - Accounts for algorithm changes and channel evolution
   - Rolling window approach (last 6-12 months)
   - Weight = e^(-days_ago/decay_constant)

4. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - **Phase 1** (Now): Basic curve from 3 snapshots per video
   - **Phase 2** (7+ snapshots): Sophisticated age-specific models
   - **Phase 3** (Months of data): Pattern detection, multiple curve types

5. **Critical Realizations**:
   - Must account for non-linear view accumulation (most views in first week)
   - Channel patterns change over time (need adaptive models)
   - Fair comparison requires same-age benchmarking
   - With 150K+ videos, even 3 points can build meaningful curves

*Session Status: Designed comprehensive approach for fair video performance scoring*

## Key Technical Insights

### View Tracking Data Applications

1. **Velocity Analysis**
   - Day-over-day retention rates
   - Acceleration/deceleration patterns
   - Early viral signal detection

2. **Channel-Level Intelligence**
   - Performance decay patterns unique to each channel
   - Content lifecycle understanding
   - Baseline performance evolution over time

3. **The "Performance DNA" Concept**

   - Show creators what happened to videos that started like theirs
   - Predictive power from historical patterns

### Implementation Priorities

1. **Quick Win**: Age-adjusted scoring for fair performance comparison
2. **Medium Term**: Channel growth curve modeling
3. **Long Term**: Cross-channel pattern matching and predictions

### Data Limitations & Solutions

- **Current State**: 3 snapshots for most videos
- **Limitation**: Can't do deep historical pattern matching yet
- **Solution**: Build models that improve as more snapshots accumulate
- **Key**: Design systems that work with limited data but scale with more

## Session 8 - Evening

- **Time**: Evening session continuation
- **Focus**: Debugging Age-Adjusted Demo Issues

## Major Bug Fixes

### [8] Fixed Critical Data and Calculation Issues

1. **Problem Discovery**: Multiple fundamental issues with the demo page
   - Expected curve showing as flat line
   - 4 data points displayed despite only having 3 snapshots
   - X-axis showing fractional days (1.123357075) instead of integers
   - Days calculation completely wrong

2. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - **Issue 1**: Fractional vs Integer Days
     - Database stores `days_since_published` as integers (0, 3, 4)
     - Code was calculating exact fractional days (0.46, 3.46, 4.46)
     - Video published at 13:01 UTC, snapshots taken at midnight
   
   - **Issue 2**: Stale Current Views
     - `videos.view_count` not being updated (stuck at day 0 value)
     - Last updated July 19, but snapshots continue through July 23
     - Code was adding stale current views as 4th data point
   
   - **Issue 3**: Growth Curve Calculation
     - Rounding ages to integers lost precision
     - Curve fitting failed with sparse integer data
     - Channel median calculation produced invalid results

3. **Solutions Implemented**:
   - **Fix 1**: Consistent Day Calculations
     ```typescript
     // Use integer days from database
     age: s.days_since_published
     // Instead of calculating fractional days
     ```
   
   - **Fix 2**: Use Latest Snapshot for Current Views
     ```typescript
     const latestSnapshot = snapshots[snapshots.length - 1];
     const actualCurrentViews = latestSnapshot ? latestSnapshot.views : v.view_count;
     ```
   
   - **Fix 3**: Improved Growth Curve Fitting
     - Simplified curve fitting for sparse data (2-3 points)
     - Added validation to prevent invalid curve parameters
     - Implemented fallback linear interpolation

4. **Testing & Validation**:
   - Created test script to verify data consistency
   - Discovered snapshot ordering issue (needed explicit sort)
   - Confirmed video age calculations and snapshot alignment

5. **Final State**:
   - Graph shows only 3 data points (matching actual snapshots)
   - X-axis displays proper integer days (0, 3, 4)
   - Expected curve shows realistic channel growth pattern
   - Performance scores accurately reflect age-adjusted performance

*Session Status: Age-adjusted demo fully functional with accurate calculations*

## Key Technical Learnings

### Data Consistency Challenges
1. **Stale Data**: Main tables may not reflect latest snapshot data
2. **Time Zones**: UTC timestamps vs local dates cause fractional day issues
3. **Sort Order**: Database results not always in expected order
4. **Query Limits**: Supabase default 1,000 row limit affects large datasets

### Growth Curve Modeling Insights
1. **Sparse Data**: Need robust fitting for 2-3 data points
2. **Integer vs Fractional**: Consistency in time units critical
3. **Validation**: Must validate curve parameters to avoid nonsensical results
4. **Fallbacks**: Always have simpler calculation methods when complex ones fail

### UI/UX Lessons
1. **Visual Clarity**: Users immediately spot data inconsistencies in graphs
2. **Component Scope**: Helper functions must be in correct scope for React
3. **Real Data**: Testing with actual data reveals issues theoretical planning misses

## Next Steps

1. Integrate age-adjusted scoring into main analytics views
2. Build SQL functions for efficient curve fitting at scale
3. Create automated tests for data consistency
4. Implement channel-level growth pattern dashboard
5. Add performance prediction based on early trajectory matching

## Session 9 - Evening Continued

- **Time**: Evening session continuation  
- **Focus**: Debugging Video Growth Trajectories Chart

### [9] Fixed Video Growth Trajectories Chart Data Display Issues

1. **Problem**: Chart showing massive X-axis range (0-2897 days) with data clustered only at beginning
   - User couldn't see actual data points despite 507 total data points
   - Chart appeared mostly empty with huge unused space

2. **Root Cause Investigation**:
   - Channel "3x3Custom - Tamar" has videos spanning 8+ years (2017-2025)
   - Recent videos: Days 8, 24, 25, 29 (visible data)
   - Old videos: Days 2800+ (stretching X-axis but no visible lines)

3. **Multiple Fix Attempts**:
   - **X-axis scaling**: Tried `domain={['dataMin', 'dataMax']}` and `domain={[0, 30]}`
   - **Shorts filtering**: Temporarily disabled to rule out data filtering issues
   - **Performance limiting**: Discovered chart limited to first 20 videos only

4. **Final Solution**: 
   - Removed `.slice(0, 20)` performance limit to show all videos
   - Chart now renders all video trajectories, not just first 20
   
5. **Key Discovery**: 
   - Issue wasn't X-axis scaling but data rendering limits
   - Chart was correctly showing full range but missing most video lines
   - All 507 data points now properly displayed

*Session Status: Video growth trajectories chart now shows complete dataset*
