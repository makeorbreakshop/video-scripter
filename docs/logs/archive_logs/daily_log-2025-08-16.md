# Daily Development Log - August 16, 2025

## Summary
Added institutional channel filtering capability to prevent news organizations and corporate channels from appearing in creator-focused discovery tools like Idea Heist.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Database Schema Enhancement for Institutional Filtering

- **Solution**:
  - Added `is_institutional` boolean column to videos table with default FALSE
  - Column designed to mark content from news orgs, corporate channels, brands, etc.
  - Preserves existing system functionality while enabling new filtering capabilities
- **SQL Executed**: `ALTER TABLE videos ADD COLUMN is_institutional BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE`
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Schema ready for institutional channel marking

### 2. Institutional Channel Analysis and Identification

### 4. Idea Heist API Institutional Filtering Implementation
- **Time**: Afternoon
- **Task**: Updated Idea Heist API to automatically filter out institutional content
- **Files Modified**: `/app/api/idea-radar/route.ts`
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added `.eq('is_institutional', false)` to random mode query (line 102)
  - Added filter to count query for accurate totals (line 165)
  - Added filter to main data query (line 191)
  - Added filter to domain list query for proper category filtering (line 273)
- **Performance Impact**: None - boolean equality checks are extremely fast in PostgreSQL
- **Result**: All Idea Heist discovery modes now exclude institutional content
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - API now filters 727+ institutional videos automatically

## Next Steps
- Consider marking additional institutional channels (sports, corporate brands, etc.)
- Add UI indicator or filter toggle for users who want to include/exclude institutional content
- Monitor discovery quality improvements after filtering implementation

## Notes
The institutional filtering system provides a clean separation between individual creator content and organizational/corporate content. This is essential for tools like Idea Heist that are designed to help creators find inspiration from other individual creators rather than professional media organizations. The phased approach (starting with news organizations) allows for testing and refinement before expanding to other institutional categories.
