## Session 1: Thumbnail Battle Speed-Based Scoring System

### Summary
Implemented and debugged a speed-based scoring system for the Thumbnail Battle game that rewards quick decision-making, mirroring real YouTube browsing behavior where users make split-second thumbnail judgments.

### Changes Made

1. **Implemented Speed-Based Scoring Formula**
   - Base score: 500 points (for answers at 10+ seconds)
   - Maximum score: 1000 points (for instant answers)
   - Grace period: 0-500ms for visual processing (full 1000 points)
   - Linear decrease: 500ms to 10 seconds (1000 → 500 points)
   - Files: `app/thumbnail-battle/page.tsx`

2. **Fixed Timer Initialization Bug**
   - Issue: Timer was resetting mid-round when background battles loaded
   - Root cause: useEffect dependency on `battle` state caused re-initialization
   - Solution: Changed dependency to only `gameState` to prevent mid-round resets
   - Result: Timer now properly tracks from round start to click

3. **Added Live Score Display**
   - Created `LiveScoreDisplay` component showing real-time points countdown
   - Shows current available points and elapsed time
   - Color-coded feedback (green → yellow → orange as time passes)
   - Positioned above keyboard shortcuts for visibility during gameplay

4. **Fixed Score Persistence Issue**
   - Issue: Wrong scores were being saved when players answered incorrectly
   - Fixed: Maintain current score on wrong answers instead of resetting to 0
   - Database field `current_score` now properly tracks cumulative score

5. **Added Comprehensive Debug Logging**
   - Timer start/stop events
   - Click timing calculations
   - Points calculation breakdown
   - Error states for troubleshooting

### Technical Details
- Scoring formula: `points = 500 + 500 * (1 - (time - 500) / 9500)` for times between 500ms and 10s
- Testing verified correct point calculations across all time ranges
- No database schema changes required - uses existing scoring fields

### Status
✅ Speed-based scoring system fully functional and tested
