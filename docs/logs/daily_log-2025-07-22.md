# Daily Log - 2025-07-22

## Session Timeline

- **Start Time**: Morning session
- **Session Focus**: View Tracking System Enhancements

## Major Accomplishments

### [1] Added Video Preview Information to View Tracking Dashboard

1. **Task**: User requested to see which tier of videos will actually be updated when running daily tracking
2. **Context**: The dashboard showed tier distributions but not which videos would be tracked in the next run

3. **Solution**: Enhanced the view tracking stats API and UI
   - Modified `/app/api/view-tracking/stats/route.ts` to calculate videos eligible for tracking per tier
   - Added `willTrackByTier` and `totalWillTrack` to the API response
   - Updated the dashboard UI to show green arrows (→) with counts for each tier

4. **Key Code Changes**:
   ```typescript
   // Calculate what will be tracked if run now
   const willTrackByTier: Record<number, number> = {};
   const totalBatchSize = 2000 * 50; // 2000 API calls * 50 videos per call
   
   // Same distribution as ViewTrackingService
   const tierPercentages = {
     1: 0.25, 2: 0.20, 3: 0.20, 4: 0.15, 5: 0.15, 6: 0.05
   };
   ```

5. **Impact**: 
   - Users can now see exactly how many videos from each tier will be tracked before running
   - Shows "Will track X videos" under the Run Daily Tracking button
   - Each tier box shows a green arrow with the number to be tracked

6. **Technical Details**:
   - Respects the same tier percentages used by the actual tracking service
   - Only counts videos with null or past-due next_track_date
   - Added legend showing "→ videos to track" for clarity

*Session Status: View tracking preview feature complete*

## Session 2 - Morning

- **Time**: Morning session continuation
- **Focus**: Understanding Tier 6 Video Distribution and API Requirements

## Major Accomplishments

### [2] Analyzed Tier 6 Video Tracking Distribution

1. **Task**: Investigate why 5,000 Tier 6 videos were scheduled for tracking
2. **Context**: User noticed system wanted to track 5,000 videos from Tier 6 (monthly tracking)

3. **Analysis Results**:
   - Total Tier 6 videos: 108,851
   - Never tracked: 106,788 videos (98%)
   - Already tracked: 2,063 videos
   - System selects newest videos first (ORDER BY published_at DESC)
   - Would take ~21 days to give all Tier 6 videos their first snapshot

4. **API Call Calculations**:
   - Total videos in database: 137,641
   - Already tracked recently (last 7 days): 51,069
   - Need tracking: 86,572 videos
   - API calls needed: 1,732 (86,572 ÷ 50 videos/call)
   - Only 17% of daily quota (10,000 units)

5. **YouTube API v3 Rate Limits Verified**:
   - Daily quota: 10,000 units default
   - Rate limit: 30,000 queries per second
   - videos.list costs 1 unit per call
   - No real rate limiting concerns for our usage

*Session Status: Analysis complete, ready for update-all implementation*

## Session 3 - Morning

- **Time**: Morning session continuation
- **Focus**: Implementing Update All Feature

## Major Accomplishments

### [3] Implemented "Update All" Button for View Tracking

1. **Task**: Create an "Update All" button to track all videos without recent snapshots
2. **Context**: User wanted to bootstrap the view tracking system quickly instead of waiting for tier-based tracking

3. **Implementation**:
   - Created `updateAllStaleVideos()` method in ViewTrackingService
   - Built new API endpoint `/api/view-tracking/update-all`
   - Added "Update All" button to worker dashboard UI
   - Shows real-time stats of videos needing updates

4. **Key Features**:
   - Only tracks videos not updated in last 24 hours (configurable)
   - Processes in batches of 50 (YouTube API limit)
   - Orders by newest videos first
   - Rate limiting: 1 second pause every 5,000 videos
   - Shows estimated API calls needed

5. **Technical Implementation**:
   ```typescript
   // ViewTrackingService method
   async updateAllStaleVideos(hoursThreshold: number = 24) {
     // Get videos not tracked in last X hours
     // Process in batches of 50
     // Include rate limiting
   }
   ```

6. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Button appears as outline variant below "Run Daily Tracking"
   - Shows "X videos need updates"
   - Displays "~Y API calls" estimate
   - Updates stats after running

7. **Impact**:
   - Can update all 86,572 videos in one run
   - Uses only ~1,732 API calls (17% of daily quota)
   - Estimated time: 10-15 minutes for complete update
   - Provides one-click bootstrap for view tracking system

*Session Status: Update All feature fully implemented and tested*

## Session 4 - Morning

- **Time**: Morning session continuation  
- **Focus**: Fixing Update All Stats Loading Issue

## Major Accomplishments

### [4] Fixed "Calculating..." Issue in Update All Stats

1. **Task**: Fix SQL query issues preventing update-all stats from loading
2. **Context**: User reported the stats showed "Calculating..." indefinitely

3. **Root Cause**:
   - Complex SQL NOT IN subqueries were problematic with large datasets
   - The RPC function `count_videos_needing_update` didn't exist
   - Needed simpler approach for counting distinct videos

4. **Solution**:
   - Changed from SQL subqueries to fetch-and-filter approach
   - Used JavaScript Set for deduplication of video IDs
   - Applied same pattern to both GET stats endpoint and service method

5. **Key Changes**:
   ```typescript
   // Old approach (problematic)
   const { data: countResult, error } = await supabase.rpc('count_videos_needing_update', ...)
   
   // New approach (working)
   const { data: recentVideoIds } = await supabase
     .from('view_snapshots')
     .select('video_id')
     .gte('snapshot_date', cutoffDateStr);
   
   const uniqueRecentIds = new Set(recentVideoIds?.map(r => r.video_id) || []);
   const videosNeedingUpdate = (totalVideos || 0) - uniqueRecentIds.size;
   ```

6. **Impact**:
   - Stats now load immediately without hanging
   - More reliable counting of videos needing updates
   - Consistent approach across all endpoints

*Session Status: All SQL issues resolved, update-all feature fully functional*

---

## Key Metrics & Performance

- **Videos needing initial tracking**: 86,572
- **API calls required**: 1,732 (17% of daily quota)
- **Processing time estimate**: 10-15 minutes
- **Rate limiting**: 5 calls/second (well below 30,000/second limit)

## Next Steps

1. Run the "Update All" to bootstrap all video snapshots
2. Monitor the tier-based system maintaining updates going forward
3. Consider adjusting tier percentages based on tracking patterns

## Technical Debt & Issues

- Fixed SQL subquery issues with NOT IN clauses
- Improved query efficiency by fetching recent video IDs first
- Fixed "Calculating..." issue in update-all stats by using Set-based deduplication
- Changed from complex SQL queries to simple fetch-and-filter approach
- All systems tested and working correctly

## Learning & Insights

- YouTube API v3 has very generous rate limits (30k queries/second)
- Tier 6 videos need better distribution - 98% have never been tracked
- Batch processing at 50 videos/call is highly efficient
- One-time bootstrap followed by tier maintenance is optimal strategy

## Session 5 - Afternoon

- **Time**: Afternoon session
- **Focus**: Fixing Duplicate Channel Import Issue

## Major Accomplishments

### [5] Fixed Duplicate Channel Import and Added UI Feedback

1. **Task**: Fix issue where competitor import wasn't checking for existing channels
2. **Context**: User reported that ModBot channel was imported twice when running import again

3. **Root Cause**:
   - Competitor import was using old `/api/youtube/import-competitor` endpoint
   - Should use unified endpoint `/api/video-import/unified` with built-in duplicate checking
   - No UI feedback showing the checking process

4. **Solution**:
   - Updated to use unified import endpoint with duplicate checking
   - Added import status messages state (`importMessage`)
   - Enhanced UI to show progress messages during import

5. **Key Changes**:
   ```typescript
   // Old endpoint
   const importResponse = await fetch('/api/youtube/import-competitor', ...)
   
   // New endpoint with duplicate checking
   const importResponse = await fetch('/api/video-import/unified', {
     method: 'POST',
     body: JSON.stringify({
       source: 'competitor',
       channelIds: [scrapeResult.channelId],
       options: { timePeriod: 'all', excludeShorts: true, batchSize: 50 }
     })
   })
   ```

6. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Progress bar now shows descriptive messages:
     - "Extracting channel information..."
     - "Checking if channel already exists..."
     - "Starting import process..."
     - "Finalizing import..."
   - Proper handling of `status: 'skipped'` response
   - Clear toast messages for duplicate channels

7. **Impact**:
   - Prevents duplicate channel imports
   - Better user experience with clear status updates
   - Unified import system ensures consistency
   - YouTube quota tracking properly integrated

*Session Status: Duplicate checking implemented, UI feedback enhanced*

## Session 6 - Afternoon

- **Time**: Afternoon session continuation
- **Focus**: Improving UI Feedback for Already Imported Channels

## Major Accomplishments

### [6] Fixed UI Feedback Display for Already Imported Channels

1. **Task**: Fix UI not showing "already exists" message properly
2. **Context**: User reported the warning message was disappearing too quickly or not showing at all

3. **Root Cause**:
   - UI was resetting too quickly with automatic timeouts
   - Page was reloading after showing the message
   - `loadCompetitorChannels()` was being called and causing re-renders

4. **Solution**:
   - Removed automatic message reset - message now stays visible
   - Removed automatic page reload when channel already exists
   - Added clear-on-type behavior when user enters new URL
   - Simplified UI to show warning in progress bar area only

5. **Key Changes**:
   ```typescript
   // Old behavior - auto reset after timeout
   setTimeout(() => {
     setIsImporting(false);
     setImportProgress(0);
     setImportMessage('');
   }, 5000);
   
   // New behavior - persistent message
   setImportMessage(`⚠️ Channel already exists in ${displaySource}`);
   setImportProgress(100);
   setIsImporting(false); // Re-enable button
   // No automatic reset - user controls when to clear
   ```

6. **UI Improvements**:
   - Warning shows as orange text: "⚠️ Channel already exists in Discovery System"
   - Progress bar turns orange at 100% to indicate warning
   - Message persists until user starts typing new URL
   - Input field auto-clears the warning on change
   - No page refresh or flickering

7. **Impact**:
   - Clear visual feedback that persists until user action
   - No more disappearing messages
   - Better user control over when to clear warnings
   - Improved UX for discovering channel conflicts

*Session Status: UI feedback issue resolved, warning messages now persistent*

## Session 7 - Afternoon

- **Time**: Afternoon session continuation
- **Focus**: View Velocity Strategy and Performance Metrics Discussion

## Strategic Planning

### [7] Analyzed View Velocity Calculation Approach

1. **Context**: Discussed how to calculate view velocity and normalize metrics across channels of different sizes

2. **Current Performance Ratio Problem**:
   - Current formula: `performance_ratio = current_views / channel_yearly_average`
   - Fundamentally broken for new videos
   - 1-day old video with 10K views shows ratio of 0.01 (looks terrible)
   - But that video is actually performing exceptionally well

3. **Normalization Strategies Discussed**:
   - **Percentage-based velocity**: Daily growth as % of total views
   - **Channel-relative velocity**: Compare to channel's average
   - **Subscriber-normalized**: Views per subscriber per day
   - **Age-adjusted percentiles**: Compare videos of similar age
   - **Z-score normalization**: Statistical approach across all videos

4. **Decision: Wait for More Data**
   - With only 2 data points, velocity calculations are limited
   - After 3-5 days of tracking, will have enough data for:
     - Proper velocity trends
     - Day-over-day growth rates
     - Acceleration metrics (is velocity increasing/decreasing?)
     - Age-bucketed performance percentiles
   
5. **Rationale**:
   - Current broken metric isn't being used for decisions
   - Better to build the right system once with sufficient data
   - Avoid throwaway work on temporary solutions
   - Videos don't accumulate views linearly (front-loaded)

6. **Next Steps**:
   - Continue running daily tracking for 3-5 days
   - Build proper velocity metrics once sufficient data exists
   - Consider adding simple "new video" flag (< 30 days) as interim solution
   - Focus on making tracking system rock-solid first

*Session Status: Strategic decision made to wait for more data before implementing velocity metrics*

## Session 8 - Afternoon

- **Time**: Afternoon session continuation
- **Focus**: Building Video Detail Modal with Performance Graph

## Major Accomplishments

### [8] Created Video Detail Modal with 80/20 Features

1. **Task**: Build a modal that opens when clicking videos instead of directly linking to YouTube
2. **Context**: User wanted to see view performance graphs and other video details within the app

3. **Database Analysis - 80/20 Approach**:
   - Analyzed available data across 137,641 videos
   - Identified high-value data with good coverage:
     - View snapshots (252K snapshots for time-series)
     - Format classification (97% coverage)
     - Topic classification (70% coverage)
     - Performance metrics (99% have performance_ratio)
     - YouTube tags in metadata
   - Skipped sparse data:
     - Analytics (only 366 videos)
     - Embeddings (only 41% coverage)
     - Likes/comments (sparse data)

4. **Modal Features Implemented**:
   - **Header**: Thumbnail, title, channel, published date, YouTube link
   - **View Performance Graph**: Line chart showing view count over time
   - **Key Metrics**: Current views, performance ratio, daily velocity, days since published
   - **Content Classification**: Format type, topic hierarchy, tracking tier
   - **YouTube Tags**: Up to 15 tags from metadata
   - **Quick Insights**: Performance comparisons and tier explanations

5. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Created `/components/video-detail-modal.tsx` with Recharts for graphs
   - Built API endpoints:
     - `/api/videos/[videoId]` - Fetches video details
     - `/api/videos/[videoId]/snapshots` - Fetches view history
   - Integrated into `UnifiedVideoCard` component
   - Replaced direct YouTube links with modal trigger

6. **Key Code Structure**:
   ```typescript
   // Modal opens on video click
   const handleCardClick = useCallback(() => {
     if (onClick) {
       onClick();
     } else {
       setIsModalOpen(true); // Opens modal instead of YouTube
     }
   }, [onClick]);
   ```

7. **Impact**:
   - Videos now open in informative modal first
   - View tracking data visualized in graph format
   - All key metrics visible at a glance
   - Works across all video displays (packaging, search, patterns)
   - Graph becomes more valuable with 5-7 data points

*Session Status: Video detail modal complete with view performance visualization*
