# YouTube Channel Discovery Scale Implementation Checklist

## Goal: Reach 1M+ Videos via Aggressive Channel Discovery

### Current Status
- [x] Current videos: 171,752
- [x] Videos needed: 828,248
- [x] Current channels: ~2,000
- [x] Available YouTube API quota: ~9,000 units/day
- [x] Existing discovery system: Already built with tables and endpoints!

### Phase 1: Enhance Existing Discovery System (Week 1) âœ… COMPLETED

#### Leverage Existing Infrastructure
- [x] Discovery tables already exist: `channel_discovery`, `discovered_channels`
- [x] Search endpoint exists: `/api/youtube/discovery/search`
- [x] Video-first search already implemented
- [x] Channel validation and filtering in place

#### Google Programmable Search Engine âœ… REQUIRED SETUP
- [ ] **Create Google Cloud Project**
  1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com
  2. Create new project or select existing
  3. Enable "Custom Search API"
  
- [ ] **Create Programmable Search Engine**
  1. Go to https://programmablesearchengine.google.com
  2. Click "Add" to create new search engine
  3. In "Sites to search" add: `*.youtube.com/*`
  4. Name your search engine
  5. Click "Create"
  6. Copy your Search Engine ID (cx parameter)
  
- [ ] **Get API Key**
  1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
  2. Create API key

  - Saves 10,000 YouTube API units daily!
  - Searches return YouTube video/channel URLs
  - Extract multiple channels per search

#### Enhance Existing Tables âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Added discovery tracking columns to discovered_channels
- [x] Created discovery_search_queries table
- [x] Created discovery_runs table
- [x] Created discovery_performance view

  ```sql
  -- Add to existing discovered_channels table
  ALTER TABLE discovered_channels ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS
    priority_score NUMERIC(3,2),
    import_priority INT DEFAULT 5,
    estimated_quality_videos INT,
    topic_alignment_score NUMERIC(3,2),
    search_query TEXT,
    search_type TEXT; -- 'youtube_api', 'google_pse', 'hybrid'

  -- Track search performance
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS discovery_search_queries (

    api_units_used INT DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
  );

  -- Enhanced discovery metrics view
  CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW discovery_performance AS
  SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at) as day,
    COUNT(*) as searches_run,
    SUM(unique_channels_found) as total_channels_found,
    SUM(new_channels_imported) as total_imported,
    AVG(avg_channel_quality) as avg_quality,
    SUM(api_units_used) as total_api_units
  FROM discovery_search_queries
  GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at);
  ```

### Phase 2: Scale Discovery with Smart Query Generation (Week 1-2) âœ… COMPLETED

- [x] Supports gap-filling, trending, and cross-topic queries
- [ ] Create query templates:
  ```javascript
  const queryTemplates = {
    educational: [
      "{topic} full course 2025",
      "{topic} tutorial playlist",
      "{topic} masterclass free",
      "{topic} workshop recording",
      "{topic} bootcamp series"
    ],
    discovery: [
      "best {topic} youtube channels 2025",
      "{topic} experts youtube",
      "learn {topic} youtube playlist",
      "{topic} for beginners channel"
    ],
    crossTopic: [
      "{topic1} and {topic2} tutorial",
      "{topic1} vs {topic2} explained",
      "{topic1} for {topic2} developers"
    ],
    trending: [
      "{topic} 2025 trends",
      "new {topic} techniques",
      "{topic} latest updates"
    ]
  };
  ```
