# Video Scripter â€” Working Dev Log (2025-06-25)
- This gets refreshed daily and the core info is saved to condensed logs
- Goal is to give Claude good active context for what we are working on

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Video Scripter is a Next.js 15 application for analyzing YouTube videos and creating content using AI. Features comprehensive video analysis pipeline with the "Skyscraper" framework, vector database integration, and multi-phase workflow for content creation.

## [1] MCP (Model Context Protocol) Testing for Supabase Integration

**Task**: Test existing MCP server configuration to verify Supabase database connectivity.

**Solution Applied**:

1. **Tested Supabase MCP Server**:
   - Verified MCP server was configured and accessible
   - Executed SQL query to check database connectivity
   - Confirmed video database table accessibility

2. **Database Query Results**:
   - Successfully queried `videos` table using `mcp__supabase__execute_sql`
   - Found **328 videos** currently stored in the database
   - MCP integration working correctly for database operations

**Technical Implementation**:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as video_count FROM videos;
```

**Impact**: 
- âœ… MCP Supabase integration confirmed working
- âœ… Database connectivity verified through Claude Code
- âœ… Can perform direct SQL operations on video database
- âœ… Ready for advanced database operations and analysis

**Status**: Complete. MCP server successfully tested and database access confirmed.
