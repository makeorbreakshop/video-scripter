# Weekly Summary - July 21-25, 2025

## Monday (July 21) - Pattern Discovery System
- **Pattern Discovery Overhaul**: System that finds viral video title patterns (e.g., "I Tried X for 30 Days") by analyzing high-performing videos across YouTube
- **Thread Expansion Testing**: AI generates related search queries from a seed topic - tested Claude vs GPT models for quality/cost
- **Pipeline Fixes**: System was losing diversity (all results looked similar) - fixed to maintain variety across different audiences
- **Search Logging**: Added tracking to see which pattern searches actually find good videos

## Tuesday (July 22) - View Tracking Dashboard 
- **View Tracking System**: Tracks video performance over time (views at day 1, 7, 30, etc.) to detect viral growth early
- **Performance Scoring Issues**: Found system was incorrectly labeling most videos as "overperforming" due to calculation errors
- **Channel Analytics Dashboard**: New UI showing how individual channels perform vs YouTube averages over time
- **Duplicate Import Fix**: Prevented same channel from being imported multiple times, added user feedback

## Wednesday (July 23) - Scaling to 100K Videos/Day
- **View Tracking Scale Fix**: System crashed handling large batches - fixed to process 100K+ videos daily within YouTube quota
- **Performance Visualization**: Charts showing expected vs actual video growth curves (like "this video should have 10K views by now")
- **Channel Growth Modeling**: Planning system where each channel gets its own expected growth curve (vs one-size-fits-all)
- **Calculation Fixes**: Fixed math errors in performance metrics that were showing incorrect results

## Thursday (July 24) - Performance Envelope System
- **Performance Curves**: Built YouTube-wide growth curves showing typical video performance from day 1 to year 10
- **View Tracking Speed**: Improved processing speed 5x (from 20K to 100K videos/day) through batch optimizations
- **Debug Tools**: Created scripts to diagnose why view tracking jobs were getting stuck
- **Real Data Validation**: Tested curves against actual YouTube channels to ensure accuracy

## Friday (July 25) - Discovery & Clustering
- **Performance Bias Fix**: 56% of videos showed as "overperforming" (should be 25%) - fixed using trimmed mean statistics
- **Discovery System**: Unified UI for finding new YouTube channels - integrated Google search (100 free/day) + auto-import
- **HDBSCAN Clustering**: Finding natural video topic groups from 170K videos (instead of forcing into 777 predefined categories)
- **Global Curve Refresh**: Updated performance expectations using 515K data points (45% new since last update)

## What These Systems Do
- **Pattern Discovery**: Finds viral title formulas to help creators
- **View Tracking**: Monitors video performance to spot winners early  
- **Performance Envelope**: Tells if a video is doing well for its age
- **Discovery System**: Finds new educational YouTube channels automatically
- **HDBSCAN**: Groups videos by natural topics (not forced categories)
