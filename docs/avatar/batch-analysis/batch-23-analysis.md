## Key Insight
May-July 2024 shows the laser market in SUBSCRIPTION REVOLT MODE. The community has evolved from enthusiastic early adopters to cynical veterans who feel betrayed by companies pushing multi-function machines with subscription software. The xTool M1 Ultra launch crystallizes this - early M1 adopters funded development only to be abandoned, while new buyers face a jack-of-all-trades machine that costs more than dedicated tools combined.

Most telling: The shift from **"which features do I need?"** to **"what are they hiding this time?"** The subscription model rejection (especially credits that expire) shows sophisticated understanding of predatory pricing. The professional/hobbyist split is now explicit - hobbyists reject subscriptions entirely while professionals calculate if they need $100K revenue to justify. The market has learned that being an early adopter means funding development for others while getting abandoned yourself.
