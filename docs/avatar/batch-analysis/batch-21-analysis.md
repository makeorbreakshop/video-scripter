## Key Insight
Oct-Nov 2024 shows the laser market reaching TRUST CRISIS. The community has discovered the hidden costs (file ransoms), exposed the influencer economy ("free lasers to anybody"), and lost faith in support systems ("3 ring binder of facts"). The OneLaser phenomenon shows desperation for disruption but skepticism about delivery. 

Most telling: The shift from **"which laser is best?"** to **"who's lying to me?"** The market has evolved from enthusiastic adoption to cynical evaluation. The Glowforge file ransom revelation ("lost hundreds of project files") represents the community's breaking point with predatory business models. Even 69-year-olds are entering the market but struggling with tutorial pacing that hasn't adapted to broader demographics.

The comment "can't afford to tell what's really wrong" reveals the community's understanding that free machines compromise reviewer integrity. This meta-awareness marks peak market sophistication.
