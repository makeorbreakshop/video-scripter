## Emerging Themes
1. **Safety Crisis**: Combo units creating dangerous material confusion

## Key Insight
The market is maturing rapidly with LightBurn as the de facto standard, but safety education hasn't kept pace with product complexity. The combo laser/blade units are creating dangerous confusion about material compatibility. Trust in reviewers is eroding as launch-day reviews become outdated before products ship to regular customers.
