## HYPOTHESIS UPDATES AFTER BATCH 6

### Hypothesis 1: Software Lock-in → Platform Independence
**Status**: CENTRAL DEALBREAKER
- Cloud dependency = automatic rejection
- Learned from other hardware failures
- Subscription model fears validated

### Hypothesis 2: Business Intent
**Status**: STABLE 7-10% BUT MORE SPECIFIC
- Ultra-niche markets (dog rescue, sports equipment)
- Apartment-based constraints acknowledged
- College students wanting to start businesses

### Hypothesis 12: Community Technical Maturation
**NEW Evidence**: Linux users, wavelength discussions, galvo understanding
**To Track**: Does open source preference grow?

### Hypothesis 13: Trust Collapse
**NEW Evidence**: Price manipulation, vendor distrust, platform hatred
**To Track**: Does this affect purchase decisions?

### Hypothesis 14: Safety Consciousness
**NEW Evidence**: "Cancer machine" fears, apartment ventilation concerns
**To Track**: Does safety become purchase driver?

## KEY QUOTE CAPTURING BATCH 6:
"Sorry you have to be an idiot to buy a glowforge. Nobody should ever buy a glowforge. Any day they can say your laser is dead and it stops working instantly. They go under your laser stops working instantly. They get hacked your laser burns down your house."

This represents the complete philosophical shift from "confused by software" (2020) to "rejecting cloud dependency on principle" (late 2021).
