## Key Insight
July-Oct 2024 shows the laser market in INVESTIGATIVE MODE. The community has evolved from passive consumers to active detectives, researching company registrations ("August 29th"), questioning marketing ("unprofessional"), and demanding proof before purchase ("birds and bushes"). The OneLaser phenomenon represents peak skepticism - a company so secretive the community assumes it's suspicious.

Most telling: The shift from **"which laser should I buy?"** to **"does this company even exist?"** The permanent eye damage report ("even with safety glasses") represents the dark side of democratized laser access. The community's rejection of theoretical business advice ("maybe make $100k before telling others") shows sophisticated understanding of influencer economics. The market has matured from enthusiastic adoption to cynical investigation, with real injuries emerging from the safety education gap.
