## Date Range: 2024-05-02 to 2024-02-10 (REVERSE! May→Feb 2024 - 3 MONTHS!)

## Key Patterns Discovered

### Goals (What They Want - Spring 2024)
- **Ultra-specific commercial**: "label switch plates" / "name tags like necklace" / "sample box inserts"
- **Professional services**: "awards and engraving business" / "print shop custom work"
- **Unusual materials**: "plastic wall switches" / "board foam for RC hobby" / "twill fabric patches"
- **Large format needs**: "20x30 working space minimum" / "60-70cm width perspex"
- **Metal processing**: "cut 18k gold 1-2mm" / "silver and gold jewelry"

### Pains (Explicit Frustrations)
- **Tutorial pacing BEYOND crisis**: "speaks...like...having...a...seizure" / "can't make it more than 5 minutes"
- **Shipping cost shock**: "$350 shipping removes KS benefits"
- **Quality control failures**: "bad tube, refused to replace" / "complete lemon"

## Key Insight
Feb-May 2024 shows the laser market in QUALITY CRISIS MODE. The community has evolved from enthusiastic adopters to brutally honest critics who openly call machines "pieces of trash" and question reviewers' "moral fiber." The tutorial pacing complaint has reached critical mass with viewers unable to watch more than 5 minutes due to delivery style. Quality control failures are being documented in detail - from stripped screws to refused warranty claims.

Most telling: The shift from **"which features do I need?"** to **"is this a complete lemon?"** The professional market is emerging (awards shops, print shops, jewelry makers) while hobbyists are trapped between low wages and laser dreams. The $350 Kickstarter shipping revelation shows how sophisticated buyers have become at calculating true costs. The market has matured from feature excitement to quality skepticism, with tutorial pacing becoming the #1 barrier to adoption.
