## PATTERNS EMERGING (Tentative - First Batch Only)

### Language Patterns Noticed:
- Heavy use of "I want to..." for goals
- "Can't figure out..." appears frequently with software/setup
- Questions often start with "What's the best..." or "Which one..."
- Technical users provide specific model numbers and specs
- Beginners use phrases like "I'm new to this" / "beginner like me"

### Common Themes:
- Software confusion is a MAJOR barrier (multiple explicit mentions)
- Cost concerns especially for jewelry/metal engraving
- Ventilation/safety questions for home use
- Confusion about what materials different lasers can handle
- Many sitting on purchased equipment they can't figure out how to use

### Expertise Spectrum:
- Complete beginners who don't understand basic terminology
- Hobbyists with some technical knowledge (3D printing experience)
- Industrial users comparing to professional equipment
- Small business starters looking for entry points

## SURPRISES
- Multiple people have expensive laser equipment just sitting unused for a year
- Software/setup is bigger barrier than cost for many
- Strong emotional language around frustration ("begging for help")
- Mix of very technical users and complete beginners in same audience
- International audience (Serbia, Philippines, Hawaii, Sweden)
- Several people trying to start businesses, not just hobby use
