## PATTERNS EMERGING (Building on Batch 1)

### Language Pattern Updates:
- Batch 1 pattern CONFIRMED: "I want to..." still dominant for goals
- NEW: "Would this work for..." becoming common for material questions
- NEW: "What do you recommend for..." standard opening for advice seeking
- STRENGTHENING: Multiple mentions of pace being "too fast" in tutorials
- NEW: Specific product comparison questions (Muse vs Glowforge frequently)

### Common Themes Updates:
- Software confusion CONTINUES from Batch 1 (LightBurn connection issues)
- NEW MAJOR THEME: Business/commercial use more prominent than hobby (jewelry, candles, firearms, denim)
- STRENGTHENING: Fire safety concerns now explicit (actual fire incident reported)
- NEW: International audience more visible (India, Germany, Philippines explicit)
- CONTINUING: Material compatibility confusion remains primary question type

### Expertise Spectrum Updates:
- Batch 1 pattern CONFIRMED: Extreme bimodal distribution continues
- NEW: More small business owners looking to add laser capability
- NEW: Specific niche professionals (jewelers, gunsmiths, quilters)
- CONTINUING: Complete beginners still prominent

## VIDEO CONTEXT PATTERNS

### Most Commented Videos in Batch 2:

## SURPRISES FROM BATCH 2
- Multiple people actually setting things on fire during first attempts
- Strong firearms/weapons customization community presence
- Jewelry making emerges as major use case (not seen in Batch 1)
- Tutorial pacing complaints are UNIVERSAL across multiple videos
- International viewers explicitly mentioning language barriers
- Several mentions of cats/pets being affected by laser operations

## DOESN'T FIT
- Flat earth debates continuing on balloon videos
- "The Earth is flat. Take out the Bible and thank God"
- Religious/conspiracy theory crossover in technical videos
- Spam from Chinese manufacturers directly in comments
- "This here a real big, injun checkup" [incomprehensible comment]

## HYPOTHESIS UPDATES AFTER BATCH 2

### Hypothesis 1: Software Complexity is Primary Barrier
**Status**: PARTIALLY CONFIRMED but EVOLVING
- Still present but less dominant than Batch 1
- Tutorial pacing emerging as equal barrier

### Hypothesis 2: Business Intent Higher Than Expected
**Status**: STRONGLY CONFIRMED
- Batch 2 shows even MORE business intent
- Specific commercial niches emerging (jewelry, firearms, personalization)

### Hypothesis 3: Expertise Bimodal Distribution
**Status**: CONFIRMED WITH NUANCE
- Middle expertise exists but in niche professionals
- They know their craft but not laser technology

### NEW Hypothesis 4: Fire/Safety Concerns Underestimated
**Evidence**: Multiple fire mentions, actual incident reported
**To Track**: Safety discussion frequency

### NEW Hypothesis 5: International/Language Barriers Significant
**Evidence**: Explicit mentions from Germany, India, Philippines about pace/language
**To Track**: Geographic indicators and language concerns
