5. **Future Visible**: 17-month preview available

## Key Insight
This batch provides an UNPRECEDENTED 17-month glimpse into the future (July-Aug 2025). The laser market has evolved from pure laser focus to multi-technology convergence. Bambu Lab's attempt at 3D printer laser integration appears to disappoint ("Do lasers ruin 3D printers?"), UV printing arrives with shocking ink costs ($300), and AI integration brings copyright concerns to the forefront.

Most telling: The shift from **"which laser should I buy?"** (2024) to **"what are the copyright implications?"** (2025). The market has matured beyond hardware selection to legal and ethical considerations around AI-generated content. The "fucking 2025" comment captures the exhaustion with rapid technology change. Industrial adoption is accelerating with inventory management needs on "pipes and drilling tools," showing professional market growth while hobbyists grapple with convergence complexity.
