## Key Insight
Late 2023 shows complete market transformation. The hobbyist maker has become a small business owner with industrial requirements but hobbyist budget. The community has taken over education, support, and validation from manufacturers. Every purchase decision is now filtered through: 1) Can I use my own software? 2) Will parts be available? 3) Is this just rebranded Chinese? 4) What's the real wattage?

Most telling: **Movie clip complaints** - even content style is scrutinized. The audience wants raw data, not entertainment. They're professionals seeking tools, not hobbyists seeking toys. The market grew up faster than the industry.
