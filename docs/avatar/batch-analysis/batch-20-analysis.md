## Key Insight
Late 2024 shows the laser market reaching critical mass with service quality becoming THE differentiator. The community has moved beyond features to demanding reliable support. Educational institutions are abandoning Glowforge en masse. Hurricane Helene's devastation reveals how many small businesses depend on these tools. The OneLaser disruption shows the market still has room for innovation, but only if backed by service.

Most telling: The shift from **"which features?"** to **"will they answer when it breaks?"** The market has matured from hobbyist tinkering to business-critical infrastructure. The 69-year-old who bought an Omtech Polar and never turned it on represents both opportunity (new demographics) and risk (support burden). The community now reviews the reviewers, questioning every claim.
