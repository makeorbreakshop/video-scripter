## Top 20 Most Common Problems/Complaints
1. "Whether it is laser engraving or laser cutting, in fact, the most important thing is two points, one is the laser power and the other is the smoothness of the frame movement.
Laser power not only depends on the input voltage and current, but also depends on the good or bad laser diode, a good diode can make you more quickly into the perfect carving, on the market these products, the laser spot compression is the best, whether you are cutting or carving, despite the product is not good but have as much as possible to Advertisement and make the spot compression of the product is difficult to show the light.https://youtu.be/qAwesZPInhw" (3 times)
2. "Be aware that many people have problems with the F1 Ultra recently. It´s kind of having a problem losing the power on the fiber laser. Meaning that even you put it on 100% power it runs like its only at 5%.

7. "This video shows many fantastic features of fusion 360 as if they were not available in Sketchup, even so, Sketchup 2017 is free to use indefinitely while fusion 360 is not, it comes with a 1 year free trial and is very difficult to reinstall and has limitations on printing models and has a learning curve that may take years.  For most uses  Sketchup fits my needs without all the complicated features.  If you are a professional modeler Fusion 360 may be the way to go for you.  . Also you really need to view this link concerning Fusion 360 https://youtu.be/5EOiuTu14tI" (1 times)

9. "I watch all of your videos and because of you I purchased a muse 3d laser yesterday :) 
I am wondering if you ever might be doing a laser cutter giveaway. I have a dear friend in Serbia who is a designer and has been so supportive of me the past several months as I've worked to afford the Muse, but sadly, despite him wanting and needing a lasercutter even more so than me, his financial situation in Serbia has been too disastrous for him to get started. If you ever do any kind of design competition ,or anything that involves winning a laser cutter, no matter how cheap, please let me know!! (I know this message may seem kind of crazy, but I'm just trying to leave no stone unturned. He's given me so much encouragement to get started in this field and it kills me to sense him feeling left behind)" (1 times)

12. "As a long time user of Autodesk software, the company is famous for leaving its customer hanging, changing rules, taking software of the market without notice and so much more, due to its dominance status within the CAD market, they have left dry a couple of times in the past. Using 360 for free is very helpful to a group of us, just don't take anything away from us, specially the axis/milling issue, just a couple of export taken away and just one sheet for drawings, I'll be looking for another option soon, thank you for the video!" (1 times)
13. "Okay, I find your video both informative and misleading. you mention the TOP laser engravers, However, you do not mention that they are all "Hobby Lasers" and not professional engravers. Nor are any of them ever mentioned in the major trade publications like Engravers Journal.  There you will see article and advertisements for the true top laser engravers. that said I have a big problem with Full Spectrum Laser.  Having done business with both Trotec and Epilog  and having been involved with a number of different types of laser, I find FSL to be the worst company in the business that I know of.  I had a Muse engraver back in 2016. Having had better machines and knowing that the Muse was only a Hobby Laser, I still found it to be a big problem. Files would not load, the Claim that corel draw files were fully compatible a joke. Having a BS in Computer Information Systems (programming major) It was clear the first day that the software had serious flaws. The design part of the software would not even display properly. Some of the tools were partly hidden and there was no way to make them display or usable. The few things that I was able to draw would not save and be available in the main window. The machine itself was flimsy and the cheaply built. Mirrors were not aligned and not easy to align. The claim FSL advertised back in 2016 that the Muse does not need to be connected with the internet to work was a marketing ploy to try to get sales that might have gone to Glowforge. Bottom line here is the claim that the Muse did nt need to be connected to the internet is both true and misleading.  The true part is that the muse can be operated while not connected to the internet. What thye don;t say much about is the fact that you do have to have an internet connection and have the Muse connected to the internet and turned on. FSL sends updates to the Muse all the time. If your machine is not connected it does not receive the updates. History since 2016 has shown that many muse owners that had machines that worked one day found that their Muse would not work at all the next day (After FSL had sent an update).  FSL lies about capabilities of their machines. They advertised that a materials database would be into the Muse. It said that on their web site and I verified it with my salesman before buying. No Muse has ever had the materials database. After I made a fuss on several Facebook forums Full spectrum Laser removed any mention that the Muse was to come with the database.  My first Muse bluescreened the second morning I had it. I let FSL talk me into a replacement machine. Thy lied about that too. First they said that if I would let them send me a replacement machine they would ship it out that same day. And they claimed it would be fully tested and working as advertised. However, that is not what happened at all. FSL waited until my first machine got back to them. Second, the second machine had the exact same problems as the first one. There 30 day 100% refund policy is something they run from. If you call tech support they will try to help you. that is as long as you go along whit what they offer. As soon as you tell them that you want to return your machine for a refund, they stop responding to you completely. Lucky for me I was persistent. I called multiple times a day and send emails several times a day. No response for 8 days. When I did get someone to talk to me he informed me that they would not pay the return shipping. Had I bought a machine and then just decided that I did not want it, that would have been reasonable. However, when you get a machine that clearly has major problems and will not work as advertised they should pay for the return shipping. So I sent the Muse back at a cost to me of $271.73. Then when FSL received the Muse they took more than 30 days before refunding part of my money. Yes, that is correct. They have a restocking fee they take out of your purchase price. Again if i was returning a work machine simply because I did not want it, a restocking fee would be reasonable.  Before I shipped the Muse back I told the at Full Spectrum Laser that I did not think it was right to make the owner of a non working machine be responsible for return shipping and then to add insult to injury charge a restocking fee.  My comments to them were that if they gave me all my money back, I would go away. However, if they did not refund all my money I would make it a point to tell as many people as possible how they do business.  Long story short I lost well over $500 to FLS. The return shipping was $271.73. Then the restocking fee took another $250 of my refund.    The only concession here is I have for my trouble is I did make a fuss on a number of forums. After more than 2 years, I contacted the head guy. we had a phone conversation. At the end of that call FSL did refund my $250 Restocking fee. However, they refused to refund the $271.73 I paid to ship their Muse back to them.  Not to long after returning the Muse I started a fb group called Muse Buyers. There I now have well over 400 members. Some have Muse engravers. Several tried to return their machine for refund. FSL stalled and would not respond to them. once the 30 day refund period ends they will respond but will not take back your machine. To be fair, of the members of my group that own a Muse, a few  have only goo things to say about it. However there are more members that have a Muse that does not work." (1 times)
14. "if i want to do more then just flat objects would this or a laserpecker be better. Or object that are bigger then your standard cutting board height wise and how hard is focusing this laser on different sized projects?  maybe a dumb       example would be things from 2x4s then going to a gun barrel something like that" (1 times)
15. "Oh my goodness, all that sawdust, on the tray, in the lens, a literal house fire waiting to not be covered by insurance due to these videos. “I don’t know what this part is, haven’t used it”, “it says be careful with the grounding but I just plugged it in and it works” for gods sake man. Water cooled by a Tupperware container with the worlds least effective lid, set directly underneath saws and other woodworking materials, this video reminds me of the building a pc video where that dude just utterly failed, but no one seems to think the same lol" (1 times)
16. "In my research, on paper the muse 3d seemed better than glowforge, especially with the rotary height extender. But the fine print only offers 30 day warranty vs glowforge 1 year. I contacted sales to confirm this. They didn't respond back. Big red flag that lead me to other complaints about service and power supplies blow often. 30 day warranty on new gear for that cash is awful." (1 times)

19. "Great video, but the title misleads... They are cheap to make, after you spend hundreds of  dollars on fancy wood working equipment!" (1 times)
20. "Excellent overview. An issue that I see with mine is that the controller seems to sometimes restricts the head to stay within a virtual 8x12 inch boundary when using K40 Whisperer, but sometimes allows the head to move outside of that boundary (I've modified my bed setup to allow 9 x 12.75 inch boards). Reinitializing the laser seems to reset things and then I can go outside of that boundary." (1 times)
