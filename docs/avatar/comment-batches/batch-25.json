    "comment_text": "Xtool advertising is misleading. They say the P2 works with Lightburn (with exception of auto focus, cameras and curve feature). Given i already have a D1 and Lightburn works perfectly with it, I had no reason to assume Lightburn wouldn't work with the P2 with the exception of the explicitly stated limitations above.  I can understand not having the curve support, but all other functions should be available. Also, the XCS software is horrible. I would not expect it to be on par with LIghtburn, but there are a multitude of little things like being able to easily define layers or remove the close up view when not needed. All in all, unless you are happy to only work in XCS (assuming full support for Lightburn never comes), save your money and buy another brand CO2 (Monoport, Omtech) and get a fiber laser to go with it for what you pay for the P2. I am posting this comment not as a criticism of the this video, but in the hopes that someone watching this video in trying to decide whether to buy the P2 or not, are more fully informed. I did a fair amount of research before buying the P2 and everyone either intentionally or unknowingly failed to mention just how limited LIghtburn for P2 is nor just how bad the XCS software is.",

    "comment_text": "I think you are spot on in your analysis. You went back to 1928, but let’s go further back: We saw the same trends with new technologies like electricity, the steam engine (revolutionised the weaving industry), the wheel…. Each time, we have seen new jobs emerge as a result.\n\nFor woodworkers, we can be divided into two categories: Some are production focussed, churning out the same chairs, tables, coasters every day in as high a volume as possible. For them, automation will be a God-send as they will be able to produce more a day. The other category are the more “creative” (no offence, producers) that hardly ever make two identical products. Here, machines may replace certain steps, but not the entire creative and assembly process. It’s especially the creative work that AI cannot replace - at least for many years to come.",

When the beam had penetrated a millimeter into the material, one would need to lower the focus by that millimeter, but then some \"sideways\" rays that come at angle wouldn't reach deep into the groove and will hit the material around the groove instead. Heating and possibly graying them. Is there a place where I can find explanations on that matter?",

You are getting a sub from me!\nI have been looking at getting a 3D printer, but had to put the purchase on pause due to another big purchase (an affordable house!) and then this bad boy dropped! My partner got excited and asked me if i would rather save up a little more money and then get this 2 in one, because i would like to try laser cutting but its not my main focus and the machines are rather expensive. \nSo here i am trying to research if the printer is worth it or not and from your review, which was sooo much more helpful since you know the details about laser cutting and most other reviewers are 3D printers, and i think i feel like this is a 100% the route i should go, i get to have the 3D printer i wanted but as an added bonus i can play around with the laser cutter function and it sounds like the quality and what you get is quite good even though the size is a trade off.\nBut i am also a hobbyist, i love trying my hand at many hobbies and i don't think i need a bigger surface to cut on to begin with, so honestly it really sounds like a great fit for someone like me, who needs the 3D printer but would love to try a laser cutter too :)",

What is the difference in the first device and the \"split\" device - for my engraving key blank application - thanks for the advice",

    "comment_text": "I believe that opening the vent enables air INTO the machine which can then go to the exhaust. Without the vent opening, this sealed machine will have no way for fresh air to get into the machine at a high enough volume to not starve the filter. It’s clever, as the vent is in the front top, while the exhaust is in the middle height at the rear. So this gives you an air flow that goes right through the shortest distance, which happens to be the area where the laser is working.\n\nIf the size of the bed is ok for people and you just don’t have the room, then this is fine. The quality seems to be pretty good. As far as the different time scales for the laser or the printer, well, you just have to manage your time. If you know what you’re going to be doing, then do the short job first. These things are a compromise. If you’re willing to accept that, then it’s great. If you can’t, then this isn’t the machine for you. But don’t forget this also cuts and draws. This might be useful and it may not.",
