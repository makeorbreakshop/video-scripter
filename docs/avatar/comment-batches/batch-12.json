Quite scary ordering from China because of the stories of it being held up at customs or people have also said theirs came damaged. But they did rectify the decision with those people.

I want to cut thin wood & use rotary, though. So I was forced to by d1 pro 10w since 20w is way too expensive right now. Speed trade off, right? If lc-40 had 10 or 20w, I definitely would have bought that. If I was ONLY engraving, it would be the best laser for that, hands down. Build is just that much better. Linear rails, no brainer.",

This needs to be addressed early in the video!\n\nAdditionally, you may not have been paid for this review, but you were provided the machine for free and your links in the description are clearly affiliate links to the product in question.

I can cut out pattern pieces of full grain leather with the knife without burning any edges, then laser engrave, all in one go. Originally, the 45-degree blades that came with the box were not able to cut through my 1.2mm veg tan, but I saw that after product launch, they released a 60-degree blade. Shipping was going to make those blades extremely expensive, so I took a risk, ran to Hobby Lobby, and bought Cricut Deep Cut blades to see if they work. They do!! Pretty sure they're the exact same blade as what xTool is selling. I would love if the Cricut knife blade would also work with the M1, but it seems more proprietary. Maybe xTool will make one. \n\nTake care!!",

    "comment_text": "Since MOPA is better for plastics, I'm curious how well a small, simple machine like this would do with PCB prototyping or small scale manufacturing. It wouldn't be too difficult to have a multi-material profile, just switch frequency and amplitude within a certain set of lines in the code. 'Etching' a PCB would be such a great alternative to the typical developing methods, as even some of the newer prototyping methods, like using a photoresist PCB blank on the LCD of an MSLA printer, still require developing in chemicals. If this could not only etch the traces, but also etch the board for proper marking, I don't see why this couldn't be a viable alternative to cheap board manufacturing. Stemming from this, I'm curious how well this kind of laser handles various solder masks, say if someone wanted to mask a whole board then etch the masking off the pads, instead of more typical processes; most PCB software already separate pads and traces, so technically you'd already have a file for just pads, with the proper settings you could potentially etch the solder mask but not the copper pad underneath. \n\nIf it works out, something like this could be great for maker spaces, assuming someone had already gone through the calibrations for specific materials, thicknesses, etc. Even as a hobbyist or small business, a machine like this would be amazing for prototyping and small production runs.",

Does the atomstack have metal rollers etc like the Xtool or is that part of the quality difference between the two?\nAlso does the 20w head weigh much more than the 10w, just thinking about wear and tear or stability of the head at speed etc?\nProbably going to boil down to one of these two for me",

No clarity on where they ship from. As an EU citizen, I have the right to know. \n\nAs per EU Standard, the seller needs to tell the customer where its dispatched when placing an order, VAT, etc. If I ask about VAT, the Xtool customer support personnel is giving an inclusive response.  What I understood is partly they want to ship from the EU & partly from outside the EU. \n\nThere is a tax obligation, depending on where they fulfill from. This needs to be clear when placing the order, if they ship from the EU, they pay VAT in one of the EU countries where you ship from. Otherwise, it's an export order, either they pay if you have IOSS registration or I need to pay on import extra cost to me. \n\nYou are mixing up, and dogging after the initial response.  Maybe Xtool is good, but not possible to buy from with in EU.  After a week of chatting with them, now I am looking into some other brand.",

Is it possible to see one of these lasers do marking on adonised panels, also which do you recommend? I have looked at the atomstack x20 pro 130w and have watched the video on this one also. I am a little torn for which one to invest in, also then is getting the laser at the right origin X/Y point. Could you possibly do a little tutorial info on this?  thanks again for another great video!!",

Does it CUT through 3/8 thick material at a slight angle since the laser beam is NOT CUTTING from Directly above at a perfect right angle to the surface being cut.  I would like to make a whole bunch of wood puzzles and I do NOT want there to be any angles of any sort on the pieces. I want the pieces to be truely Square to the surface. So since the laser is NOT MOVED directly above I would guess that the laser is always cutting at some varying angle to the surface of material being cut which for my uses makes it a worthless device for me to have.

Funny thing is that the side rulers are in Imperial (inches) but everything else is based on MM . Also my air assist only came with one nozzle ...But mine did come with a switch . To solve the issue with all the extra hose as you pointed out I was able to add a small shelf above the D1 and added a loose fitting wire tie around it and the wire harness so they travel together , no issues so far. Time for a clink and install table . as always thanks for all your videos and help ! Keep up the informative and entertaining stuff ! Cheers !!       John in Florida    A.K.A.  Fla Dude  🙂✌",
