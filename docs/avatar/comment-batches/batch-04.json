    "comment_text": "I'm about to say something that will make the wood movement police go crazy. But whatever. Lol. My experience supports it. \n\nWood movement... It's a \"common tale\" that as external humidity changes, so will your projects... Well... That's honestly not the case if you have your home well insulated and at a consistent humidity. Which most houses are. Most antique furniture doesn't break from wood movement when sitting in a house.... They break from wood movement when people put them in garages and barns where there is no climate control. Then the wood movement starts setting in and everything gets all crazy. And also .. wood movement can be overpowered and controlled. Just look at high quality sheets of veneer ply. \n\nIf you are building something for an interior job, honestly it will likely shrink a little over the next 1-6 months when bringing it in from your shop (especially if your shop isn't well controlled with it's humidity and temperature .)\n\nI've sold very expensive veneered signs, laminated chess boards with highly figured cross grain, and even tables with cross grain on them. As long as you expect a little shrinkage and it's gonna be climate controlled.... You honestly don't need much for wood movement. \n\nYou don't believe me? Go to the Las Vegas airport and go to the Jamba Juice inside the terminal. There is a hickory table there with no proper breadboards, held all together with glue and dominos. Breaks all the rules and it's perfectly flat and strong with perfect joints. \n\nAlso, the Samurai Carpenter and many of my fellow pro woodworker friends agree with me. Yes wood moves. But not as much as people think on indoor furniture. And a little known fact about wood glue.... It's actually not a true solid once cured. It can allow for a surprising amount of wood movement and shifting and still keep it's bond. Honestly man you could have just glued and mortise and tenoned that baby on for the breadboard. The bigger issue isn't the breadboard... It's the fact that you are using construction lumber. The 2x6s are gonna get way more contraction than just going down to the hardwood store and buying poplar. And it actually will be surprisingly similar in cost. But the moisture in that framing lumber may be enough that it blows that a perpendicular wood joint out. But if you are using dry high quality woods... My statement stands.",

Given the price level of these things are built to it's also entirely possible for the laser to just go into high power mode on its own to do some sort of circuitry or programmatical failure.\nA good quality set of laser goggles is probably the most important thing you can buy when dealing with anything laser. Also make sure it is the right goggles for the wavelength of laser you are using.",

For cutting thicker materials it also gets in the way because there's only a 2mm gap at optimal surface focus.\n\nI made a temporary enclosure out of cardboard and piped in a 170cfm (advertised flow) exhaust blower. It's not ideal or the safest enclosure material, but I never leave the laser unattended when in operation and have a small ABC extinguisher nearby. The blower is marginal for extracting the smoke, but that's likely due to the \"enclosure\" having an open front.\n\n\nMine is good to etch at faster than 9000, but at those speeds I haven't tested the accuracy. For slate coasters, it will even produce a textured surface at medium speeds.",
