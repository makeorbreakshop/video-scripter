    "comment_text": "Good and informative review. Thank you! Just one question.. With CO2-lasers the air assist near or on the nossle is for clearing the smoke and fumes, so the beam is unobstructed for a sharper, better result and the focusing lens gets less wear due to particles sticking to it and burning in. In the video you mention air assist, or lack thereof, on diode lasers, but as a lacking safety feature for putting out fires.. Is the use of air assis that different in the two types? In my experience the air assist can promote the opposite, as it fans any fire, adding more oxygen.",

    "comment_text": "Hi Brandon, I have to say, you are the only person that I watch when it comes to laser talk. Though I know nothing of the machines and most of what you speak of is a foreign language to me, I enjoy watching them all the same. With that being said,  I am seriously in need of suggestions because I have absolutely no idea what I need to purchase, especially since I have never laid eyes on a laser/engraver in my life.\r\nWhichever one I purchase will be going inside my craft room in my house. The room is 25 ft long X 13.5 wide so space is not an issue, however, the entrance to my house is only 34‚Äù wide, so it would have to be small enough to go through the entrance.\r\nIn no particular order, these are the things that I would love to learn to create‚Ä¶ Jewelry pieces (namely earrings) from wood, leather, and acrylic. I‚Äôd like to be able to cut out the wood to assemble jewelry boxes, shadow boxes, keepsake boxes, small-medium-sized desk organizers, and similar items. I would also like to be able to learn how to make round door signs (at least 15‚Äù), 3D layered designs and other wall decorative items.\r\nI would love to be able to learn how to engrave on leather and acrylic, books, personalize journals, wallets, and a few other items. I am not new to crafting, just new to laser cutting/engraving.\r\nI would greatly appreciate all suggestions that could help me make my final decision as well as any other equipment that could help make things run smoother and of course, the more budget-friendly it is, the better.",

You're the gold standard when it comes to laser reviews on youtube.\nI've been on the market for a laser for quite a while now and can't seem to make up my mind, so I really appreciate these vids.\nI know I want a dual diode laser. My 1st choice right now is atomstack x7 as they now are promising air assist to be released for it soon. Neje was on my radar, but their setup seems very \"janky\" and I've heard they're overdriving their diodes way too high = shorter lifespan.",

I have a Meterk DK-BL model that is the size of a Jack in the Box but it doesn't have the power to really burn nicely into some woods and I have ruined some projects that I have turned on the lathe due to the object moving as the diode head moves, or the type font not being in real-time what was on the screen.  I might not know what I am doing as well. I am not going into business but rather a simple hobbyist that likes to give nicely engraved gifts to friends.  I would like to stay under $400 if possible.  Thanks in advance.",
