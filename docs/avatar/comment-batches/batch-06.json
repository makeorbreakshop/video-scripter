Mostly on wood, but i would like to have open option to engrave on metal, it doesnt need to be deep, just enough to not be wiped off. I would like to buy if possibly around 700$. But i will work a lot on that laser and i need it to work long term. Do you reccomend atomstack x7 50w dual laser? I also looked at ortur laser master 2 pro, but as i saw it is weak to cut through even 5mm wood. What do you think about x7 and if not can you reccomend me something else. I cant get xtool d1 shipped to my country(Serbia). And is it better to order from aliexpress or from official site, because sometimes the difference in price is arond 50-100$. By the way i love your videos, they are very detailed. Sorry for the gramatical errors my english isnt the best.",

They claim it can cut 6mm Basswood in one pass. My main use for a laser is cutting through 1.5mm hardwood (.062) of different species (Maple, Cherry, Walnut, etc). If you ever have a chance to check out that capability, I'd lover to know how it goes. I have a Glowforge now, but when it dies, I'd love to find a cheaper alternative. Thanks again for the detailed laser reviews!",

    "comment_text": "The software that is shipped with the LaserPro is buggy and and not very powerful. LaserPro is not compatible with Lightburn - yet - they are working on it. However after several weeks playing with it, I found that with a very simple GCODE header and footer added to the Lightburn configuration file, the LaserPro will (mostly) run with Lightburn. It has a very small spot and is very powerful. It easily cuts 3mm plywood at 225mm/min at 95% power, and engraves literally everything. It has an internal fan that provides air assist, blowing air from the same orifice as the laser, and the lens is recessed in the laser head so smoke does not settle out on the lens. The auto focus works great, and the enclosure with the fan lets you vent the smoke out a window. The video camera takes a bit of careful setup but is extremely useful. When the LaserPro is fully Lightburn compatible it will definitely be the diode laser engraver to buy. My LaserPro is now the one I use for all my projects, and my previous laser engraver (which I was very happy with) sits pretty much idle.",

The big thunder we have has like a 3ft × 4.5ft cutting area which seems insane, but one thing we have noticed with it is that the laser's cutting power gets weaker as you move away from the source, so you can't really utilize the full cutting area as easily.  That's probably just as issue with such a large laser, so keep that in mind.  Still an awesome machine and I love being able to get my hands on that pro grade stuff",

Eithers' most difficult and frequent use case would be for a teacher cutting paper, cardboard, and occasional thin (6mm or less basswood/balsawood) for young student projects. Along with doing engraving for gifts and occasional sales (once or twice a year flea markets, no online shop).  Would a 4\" hose and exhaust fan to outside *near* the xTool be enough in a basement shop? I've got preexisting 4\" exhausts running for airbrush and resin 3d printers. Or should we really use an enclosure?  Really like the xTool build quality and what seems to be a better laser module with dual diode. \"Good enough\" software doesn't seem to be a problem since it doesn't need a persistent online connection like glowforge. The big thing that has me hesitating on this xTool is that the Ortur has an optional enclosure, seems to have more reviews, more mods, and more units actually out there in the hands of hobbyists.",

Perhaps include a quickie on how to get dimensioned 2D drawings along with the nice model?  Its a pretty simple thing to do, and would be critical for anyone needing this to construct the table.  For my class, I have every student submit a set of pdf's along with the f3d model that show top, front and side views with all important dimensions labeled, or I take points off their projects...this one should also include an exploded view of the joints you made. \n\nGood video though!",

You can not only change sizing on the fly but you can also animate door openings, drawers and check for collisions etc. This is HUGE! You can change material thickness etc. Rendering....well, that depends on what you are trying to accomplish. Sketchup uses companies like VRay and Lumion..... Fusion 360s internal renderer cant compare. That does require an additional software purchase, but being that was a point brought up I assume we are focusing on quality of render potential and Vray simply cant be touched. One huge advantage Sketchup has over Fusion 360 is Layout, the quality and ease of use to create amazing drawings is a big need for me. Again both of these programs are solid, it just depends on what you are doing and what you need. I would not count sketchup out as it is very powerful, and even more so when paired with quality plugins. I do like Fusions CAM capability though, I currently export to Aspire, but 3d shapes would\n be nice to toolpath on screen like that. Thanks for the video!",

    "comment_text": "The ORTUR looks like it be good for some DIY 3D printer, with some modifications.\n\nI worked at a place that used a type of plastic powder, in the consistency of baby powder. Wile sitting in it's shaker, it looked like bubbling liquid. Wile in that state, it is sucked up with a positive charge added to it, and sprayed on a metal part with a negative charge, to make the powder paint stick to it. After, it goes into an oven to melt the plastic onto the metal as a covering. Comes in many colors.\n\nIf one was to have a table that a slider arm will lay out a thin layer of that powder onto a table, the ORTUR could be use to trace out the shape of one layer to a 3D part. The table would drop by one layer, as the slider arm adds another layer of powder. The ORTUR traces out that next layer, before the table drops again. Repeat, until all layers are complete.\n\nUse a small vac to suck up the unused powder, and you got a 3D part. Trick is, getting the ORTUR to be part of that automated task. Could be make possible with a Raspberry PI I think.\n\nWould prove to be a neat project. And cost vastly less than other 3D printers that do such already costing over 15,000 for a low end 3D printer of that type.",

I also expanded the bed area by cutting down the exhaust shroud. I did run through a major tune-up and alignment to really dial everything in before use. I didn't bother with a chiller, a 5-gallon bucket serves me just fine. I also haven't bothered to upgrade the controller board, the original works just fine for my workflow with K40 Whisperer. I mainly use it for cutting plastic or plywood parts for prototyping rather than engraving, so the stock controller is fine. All in, it easily came in under $800 to have a very versatile machine in my arsenal that I can add and upgrade to later if needed.",

If you use it out of this range the module will fail within months. Btw. even the good cheap china fiberlaser modules on these machines are RFL-P20QE versions with have a range of 20-60kHz.

Back then you connected to it, as a printer, so Epilogue provided a print driver. Being older it had no USB, so it has a parallel printer port connector. But I \"printed\" thru Corel Draw, which would both cut and engrave. The engraving portion, was provided with a simple image file format (.jpg, .png, .bmp, etc), and the cutting with a vector format (.dxf), that I imported into corel, to make the final file, to be engraved & cut out. Is this still an option on modern engravers ? The prices on these new units are hobby affordable, as Epilogue units start around $20K, so not going to happen, unless you're in the business.",

They get hacked your laser burns down your house. You lose internet for any reason you have a brick until you get service restored. They will someday say we want a monthly fee for you to use your laser, you will have no choice but to pay. That is the only reason for their design choice of no offline usage, you will be forced sooner than later to pay a monthly subscription to use your machine. Anybody who says different is a liar.

    "comment_text": "When it comes to software, it's also worth pointing out which ones rely on online services. I know you said \"web based\", but not everyone quite gets what that means. Having been screwed by a company going out of business, turning my 3d printer into a brick, I will never buy tools like these that require an online service (as opposed to web-based software served up from the tool, like most routers). For the price of something like the glowforge, I'd want to ensure I could use it for as long as I decide to.\n\nProprietary software (that they eventually stop updating) is another no-no, but at least you can work around that by keeping a frozen PC around for the life of the tool. No way to work around a service requirement, though.",
