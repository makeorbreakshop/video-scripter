Just got the D1, and quite frankly its pretty mobile should I find the need to move it. The D1 has a slightly smaller list price for 10w vs 1.5w at the laser, and has half the light beam diameter. I think anybody who dropped bank on this wizard gadgetry would be buying on impulse, but quickly have buyers remorse after the low quality results become the apparent norm.",

    "comment_text": "I received this laser this week and I have to say it is a sexy POS.  They say it works now with lightburn, well it does not.    I have had nothing but problems with it.  It crashes into the wall all the time.  When you tell it to home, it crashes into the wall.  If you try to frame your work to tell where you need to put you material, it crashes into the wall.  There are no limit switches on this laser so it has no idea where it is.  If you want to put your work in the middle of the field, well good luck.  I tried everything and it would only work in the upper left corner.  There is no emergency stop switch, so if you have a problem you have to fumble  around for the power switch.  Not something you want to do if you have a real problem.  I ordered the rotary with this laser but did not get it.  I had to contact support to find out that it was on backorder, and they never even thought to email me to let me know.  There is no factory air assist with this laser, and that would defiantly come in handy.  Their setup video is horrible.  It moves so fast that you can't really tell what they are doing and what part that are using.  I have to say DON'T buy this if you are new to laser engraving, and even if you are a seasoned  person it will be hard to get it to work properly.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from this laser.  Sorry to put this up but I think it will help a lot of people.  This is not a well thought out machine. Yeah it looks sexy and well built but it's not worth the price at all.  I will be getting an Ortur for sure.\nI do think that you can learn a lot from this channel though.  He really seems to know his stuff.  Keep the videos coming, and thank you for all you do for this hobby.",

    "comment_text": "I would love to hear your advice actually\r\nI've been looking at your videos now for quite a while because I am getting more and more interested in buying my own laser cutter. I have a lot of experience with MDF as well as resin printers. Even before I used to go to the city workshop where I operated with their CO2 Laser (HyperCUT 6090 PRO).\r\n I can print a lot of things with my printers but still I would love to be able to cut and engrave stuff.. + with wood you get that warmer feeling if you give some sort of gift. I would love to have a machine that is capable of cutting good as well as engraving. Mostly I would cut some sort of stands and smaller chests or boxes for storage or decoration. material wise; Foam, MDF, acrylic and vinyl. So with this cutter it's really, really tempting. Price is fair, even though I was always in love with Co2 lasers and dreaming about getting one because of speed and enclosure and everything else. I also looked at some of your other videos like OM Tech K40 and its bigger 50w brother but with K40 the problem is cut volume and with 50w machines the problem is price. So if you were in my position, which machine would you recommend me getting? Should I save up the money and buy bigger CO2 for like 1500 - 2000€ or should these smaller diode machines work well enough for me? Thank you for your answer!!",

I bought it for the 10w laser, but had I known it would not use industry standard software, I would have made a different choice.\nBy the way, do not upgrade from laserbox basic 1.1.0 to 1.0.1 it breaks the positioning ability on the burn screen.  The earlier version works when you try to position the laser using the buttons to go left, right, up or down.  On the new release, it seems to be very harsh on the motors and the laser starts moving diagonally (not in a straight line) as intended.  Again, the software is beta release at best.",

Second, Meerk4t will allow a lot more flexibility to your laser power, I think it does fast switching rather than varying the power.. It's not in Lightburn territory but it's way better than Whisperer and it's free.\nThird, the fan is upgraded, most now come with a perfectly adequate fan, rather than that dire fan on earlier models. Remove the internal ducting and you have really good extraction.\nThis means that you will only be spending around $100 for air assist and mirrors to get a very workable machine that competes with the Glowforge on most jobs.",

Already ordered a 10 watt D1, and hope it'll be a good unit to learn on.  I was thinking about using this to cut vinyl for decals and stickers, like the vinyl cutters, and hope there's a way to do that with this machine, so I won't have to buy a cutter as well.  Any advice would be appreciated, happy cutting and engraving to everyone!!",

    "comment_text": "Very informative reviews. One note: You have the endemic YouTuber problem. Not as bad as most but still pretty irritation. You wave and flail things you are holding as if we should look at them, but we can't. Check when you \"show\" the piece of basswood. You would not flip and wave it in the face of a friend would you? Part of this is also the wild arm wavings and gesticulations like you are doing a rap concert. I bet you do not do that in person either, or maybe people just stand well back to avoid injury. This breaks the personal experience of the video and gives some \"This Old House\" vibe (meaning poorly scripted, over acted). Basically you act like you are speaking to an audience, but you are not. On YouTube you are speaking one-on-one. Just my 2 cents. Keep up the good work.",

Any advice that gets me from Inkscape drawings to the cut would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance :o)",

I just bought one for 330$ with upgraded Metal extruder and also added \"New Dual Blower Kit\" to the cart on their website. Since i can see most reviewers agree that the cooling is lacking. This will be my first 3D printer, seems like you get pretty decent build volume for the money, other competitors seem to charge at least 100$ more for the same volume, and still dont give you a touch screen.",

Will need to install an air assist system to improve deep cuts. The only thing missed in this video is discussing how some sellers of diode lasers mislead buyers by specifying the power used by the diode rather than it's actual optical (cutting/engraving) power. As an example, I have another diode laser that is sold as a \"15W\" laser but actually puts out around 4.5 watts of cutting/engraving power. 15 watts is the amount of power it requires from a power supply.",
