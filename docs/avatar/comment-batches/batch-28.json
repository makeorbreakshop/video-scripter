    "comment_text": "I put down my deposit so now I'm just waiting for the Kick to start.  I have a few questions, I'm hoping you can answer.  1) How long do the resin cartridges last, ie: how much can you print?  I know that is somewhat subjective, based on what you print, and how much of each color you use, but take your Mando print on wood.  How much resin did that take?  How many of those could you print with a single kit?  2) Since the printer has to lay down a white layer under anything that isn't being printed on a white surface, is the white tank bigger than the colors?  I think I saw somewhere that the ink kit would be around $300 to replace, and if you're going through that (and/or a cleaning kit) every few months, that has a pretty high cost of usage.  3) I saw another video about printing on tumblers and cups and it seemed to suggest that the machine was pretty picky about the sizes and shapes of tumblers it works with.  The ones you demo'd appear to be Eufy branded, so not just any old tumbler.  It loses a lot of flexibility if you can only print on their materials.  4) The sticker lamination set up looks like it might require some kind of transfer material, and I'm wondering if that is also proprietary.  I live in Alaska, so I'm really cautious about new tech with proprietary media / materials, because all too often companies don't ship to Alaska or treat it like a completely foreign country.  ($200 to ship a $99 thing - Xtool won't even ship replacement lenses or mirrors to Alaska).  Thanks in advance.",

    "comment_text": "Wait, if it's taking an existing image and then just putting your product in it, as you showed in the example with the Emma tag on the folded napkin, how is that not plagiarism? It's not like it's even really making a new image, you're literally feeding it the image you're copying, call it inspiration all you like, but it's just plagiarism with the extra step of telling the computer to do it for you. And frankly, why bother with chatGPT if you're just gonna plagiarize things, you can already do that for free.\n\nAs for selling your photos with generated images of your product, I would say that's just false advertising. If you're portraying something as a photo of the product, and it's not a photo of the product, you're just lying, again, with extra steps. And sure, if you want to sell your product by lying, that's hardly a new idea - just ask El Nasir - but let's at least be honest with ourselves about what we're doing here.\n\nLook, man, I'm not entirely against AI being used as a tool. There are even ethically trained AI models out there(even if ChatGPT isn't one of them). But this this isn't helping folks, it's the opposite. It's just a way to have people offload essential - and fairly easy to learn, in my experience - skills for a creative business to a tool they don't control, and ensuring they are turbo-screwed when those tools change or go away, as well as essentially telling people to do sketchy and in some given examples downright unethical things like it's normal and fine.\n\nIf you want an example, let's say, hey, someone spun up a business doing portraits of people in Ghibli style using chatGPT...they'd have some angry customers right about now, because in the time between filming and this video being made, ChatGPT has taken that feature offline, with no indication of when it will return. Which is especially ironic, considering Brandon's quite reasonable complaints with hardware about not having it in your control, and a third party being able to shut you down arbitrarily, at any time, with no recourse.\n\nAnd no, I don't expect this comment to last too long, a few hours at most, whenever Brandon's part of the US wakes up. But that's fair enough, I've said my piece, so no skin off my nose.",

The main thing I would be doing is leather key chains & tumbler cups. I always wanted to do t-shirts. I have a heat press machine. A Cricut & a 2nd vinyl cutter. But I DEFINITELY need to add this to my collection. Gr8 video my man. I'm sold on this. Gotta handle sum other things 1st but I'm definitely putting in an order for this. Also I saw where the price is now 3699. So I guess I'll be saving a bit of money. That's always a good thing. Awesome video. Thx for posting",

Now I can finally make these parts without using those crappy regular subtractive manufacturing techniques that leave 90deg cuts, so inconvenient!",

    "comment_text": "I hope if the price is expensive, I wish buy only the cnc laser fiber cutter separately than the laser welder. For welding we have alternatives like mic, tig, etc. And if the price is more than 3500 dollars or euros most buyers like me we will can't buy it because we want it only for hobbies. Also I think this is first step to democracy the metal cutting laser. In my case I was waiting this type of machines lots of years. Congratulations to @xtool. Now the price is critical.",

    "comment_text": "I’ve played around with a diode engraver I got on Temu a couple years ago and it worked well for soft materials, but I’ve always wanted to find something to engrave chrome plated tools. I personally have a couple thousand pieces to engrave, and I was thinking I could provide engraving as a service to other technicians to help pay for the machine (who also have lots of tools) and I would also provide personalized enamel filling. What wattage would be best for chrome vanadium, speed isn’t critical, and engraving points will tend to be small (~25mm^2 or less)? I also wanted to know what kind of surface treatment I may need when working with reflective chrome plated tools.\n\nAny and all help would be awesome!",
