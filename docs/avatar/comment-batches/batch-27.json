Any recommendations on which one I should get? And for a second machine would it be best to get a xTool F1 Ultra or an Apparel Printer that does Print To Bake? which do you think would give me a better spread to cover more ground? and any suggestions on one? I am very new to the field, watching your videos and motivated to get my feet wet and start working hard! I appreciate any advice you can give me. Thank you.",

You can buy UV ink in 1kg bottles if you own a regular UV printer... the inks expire quite fast, and you have to constantly clean/cycle the printer. If you think your dead inkjet printheads were bad, UV is infinitely worse and requires a lot of maintenance. I can definitely see people with dried up print heads if they just do this for fun once in a while. \n\nThat said, this is a really interesting and unique take on a UV printer but just the ink cartridges is an instant no for me. Bad to say, but I really hope someone else takes this idea and makes a ink tank version that works with regular UV ink on the market. lol.",

The importer on record for the parcel is the one paying the tariffs unless the exporter precollects it and then pays customs. So it could mean that Eufy pays the tariff or it could mean that Eufy is not collecting the tariff, and it's your problem when it arrives.",

    "comment_text": "🙋‍♂️ Warranty’s don’t cover everything. This machine has proprietary parts like a Glowforge, so when it breaks, you’ll likely have to pay to ship it to China for repairs, covering shipping and tariffs both ways, which could get pricey fast. The ink is already overpriced at $299 for 600ml, and with tariffs, it jumps to $477 to ship to you—that’s $12.50–$23.50 for just 100 small prints, compared to the 3060UV-V2’s $0.13 (one of many uv desktops) eufyMake’s lack of transparency on ink usage and support is a red flag, and they’ve already abandoned their 3D printer backers in the past, leaving them with nothing. They’re promising free shipping on 6,437 units, but that’s $7.9 million in shipping and tariffs they might not handle. If they do, this risks delays or hidden fees. You’ll also have to raise your prices much higher than expected to recoup costs on this toss-away machine. Also, could you please provide precise ml/print data for different print types (e.g., small prints, 3D textures, A4 prints) to help us calculate true costs Also, are there plans to ship from the United States for us to avoid tariffs? Or is this printer going to collect dust from customers that can’t afford the now higher cost for the ink?",

Where the cost is $22 in ink, and 7 hours to print. And when so many people buy these UV printers, the market will be flooded with people selling raised prints. The tumbler and mug markets are already saturated with sublimated items. The flat metal market, and sticker market the same. With heat transfers, sublimation, vinyl, direct to film (dtf), white toner laser, and other uv printers, the market is saturated with sellers using these technologies. This printer looks so cool, but that's also its problem ... when tons of people buy them, the market will be oversupplied with sellers. That's not a market I want in on. Etsy and eBay will be flooded with AI, raised/textured prints within days. And it will be a race to the bottom.\nI have been turned off by so many other youtube channels that seem to be just shills for this printer.\nThank you for pointing out some of the cons, and holding off your review until you get a production unit.",

The shipper called me and said it would be here Tuesday and they would call 30 minutes out.  Well, my wife was home all day because she is a kept woman 😜but they never called and just dropped it in the driveway… My wife called and said your laser is here but I can’t move it! lol So delivery is not the best. It sat in my driveway until I got home. Just know, no porch pirate is going to snatch it off your property.  It weighs 179 pounds! This is not your parents’ xTool  Laser!! It is a quality built Professional engraver. I am using the included exhaust system and it works pretty good. But I may upgrade it in the future. My xTool D1 20 is a great machine but it did not come with an enclosure or vent system. Is it fast? Yes. Yes! Can you get a darker image than he did? Yes. If you are just a hobbyist I would stick with the xTool brand. They are the best bang for the buck. But if you are a semi-pro or are looking for a side gig this machine is a no brainer. Just make sure your cousin Eddie is around to help you get it up on your work bench because my little 5 foot wife was useless when it came to that!",

    "comment_text": "Nah... most of us that are deep into printing, know that there's only a handful of chemical ink producers, and it's no longer the 90s, and basically everyone follows very similar formulas and pigment densities. UV ink is only special in it's resin binder that's activated by very specific wavelength of UV light. The most common is 395um. But even still many commercial UV inks will cure within a range of 385um to 405um.\n\nThat being said... if I bought this printer, the first thing I would do is learn the cartridge system, and see if they are chip coding them or not. And secondly, if there was a way to non-destructively refill them. BECAUSE, even really good 3rd party UV ink should only cost you between $15-20 per liter. There might be some variance on the white, it's particle size and what specific inkjet heads they are using. Again, this is a start-up, so I promise you they aren't designing their own piezo electric print heads from scratch. They are sourcing them from Ricoh or Epson. If you know which one, you can buy inks specifically tailored to that particular print head. It's not that complicated.\n\nRemember, ALL printer companies make their business model around you, the customer always buying ink from them, keeping them in business.",

At the forefront is \"3D relief\" or \"depth printing\" and that, from your brief answer, seems to be tied to a subscription that gives credits. Free tier has limited use, but based on their \"you can make this much per day printing with this machine\" the cost in credits should be calculated into this. \n\nRegardless, great product, wonderful price for entry. A bit shady in not being upfront and clear as to how much total running costs will be. I'd hoped companies would take note after the BambuLab \"this is how we will operate going forward\" backlash but looks like more *asterisk* stuff could be on the radar. \n\nThanks for the updates again. See if you can get more information on the subscription tiers/specifics. If it's anything like Adobe (which I love, but costs a bit) then this is something to definitely factor into the cost of printing products as well as the ink.\n\nImagine a tradeshow/event with a line of 20+ clients and you run out of \"credits\" for generation...ChatGPT like tiers?

Otherwise after one week, when the novelty runs out, people will place their machines to sleep. But if the percived price is afordable, people will exepriment and move on. After 1 year the company could re-evaluate the price of paint. Even if they increase the price over one year will be less damaging to the company, since people will already have hfound their niche and be able to properly evaluate continuity. Just my 2 cents.",

The key is, this is not a regular home printer, this is a professional UV Printer. The price that you should be charging your customers should be 3x or or higher depending on what you are printing and the method. I already have a UV Printer, a Roland flatbed, here is an example of what I charge for a name tags. We just completed an order of 90 name tags and we charge $10 each, out cost per name tag was around $1.50, we ganged the name tags on our flatbed. So a few jobs can definitely pay of this machine, just don't under sell your time and products.",

    "comment_text": "Established companies like Anker, the owner of Eufy, should not be using Kickstarter as a funding platform. These corporations have ample financial resources to support their own projects, yet they turn to crowdfunding as a way to shift all risk onto consumers and backers. If their product fails—like their previous 3D printers—these companies remain unaffected, profiting from sold units while losing nothing on research and development.\nWhat makes this situation particularly concerning is that working units of the product already exist, as multiple YouTubers have demonstrated in their reviews. So what, exactly, is being “Kickstarted”? The manufacturing process? This is not what Kickstarter was originally intended for. Unfortunately, more and more established and profitable companies continue to exploit the platform, using it as a shield to protect their investments rather than a genuine tool for innovation.\nThis unethical practice places all financial risk on backers, who are left vulnerable if the product fails. Meanwhile, content creators often enable this cycle by eagerly accepting free units and promoting them without scrutiny. If influencers refused to provide exposure to these companies without genuine accountability, failed launches could force corporations to rethink their approach and adhere to proper business practices.",

I didn't catch it, but does it automatically know to place down white or do you need to do it?\nDoes it have the firmware backdoor that all paper printers have?\nHave you tried lasering then uv printing on metal so that there is no relief?\nI hope they do not get you with the ink or make it obsolete with upgrades.\nNice way to setup your printer label.\nWhat a dust and fingerprint magnet, eh?",
