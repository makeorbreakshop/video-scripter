What are the replacement cost for the laser, airlifters etc.  I know we are comparing a diode to a Co2 but I am not sure which is better for a beginner. Until now I thought Glow forge was my only options for a self contained desktop laser with a camera and easy to use, now there is a choice, so the question is which one. Thoughts?",

Some diode lasers are advertised to be able to run up to 24000mm/min, which is equal to 400mm/s, so theoretically they could do the same as CO2 laser. Perhaps in case of 300mm/s even 40w optical power would not be enough fo good result, but I am confused why people are not running such tests on yt - usually they go up to 10000mm/min.",

Its been my workhorse for the small things I make, but has recently started stopping mid burn on everything even after multiple attempts with cleaning, customer support assistance, etc. So I decided I want to upgrade and was considering the 40w, but xtool is telling me I need to purchase a pro AND then the 40w like you said in the video. Kind of pointless to buy the pro when its only for the rail system and it would be waste of the laser. I wish they offered a complete 40w kit. Im considering throwing my hat into the co2 ring and going with an Omtech 50w. Currently its $250 off so its pretty close to the same price if I would purchase the pro and then the 40w upgrade. Whats your opinion? Keep up the videos too! Theyre very informative!",

I would like to improve speed with both engraving & cutting (I mainly engrave ceramic tiles, slate & mirror, but also glass & stainless steel) & would like to cut 4-6mm ply/mdf/acrylic. Would the RF CO2 laser still get similar quality on engravings at a much faster speed & would cutting be a lot better with the glass tube C02? Also, when engraving ceramic/acrylic/glass etc do C02 lasers still need the various paints to mark/burn materials? Thanks for this video btw (been waiting for your opinion)",

With diodes you can mask the material and it stops charring on the back of the item.  Is this needed on CO2 devices?  Do you also need to get the honeycomb to protect the materials?  If not this may be savings between the different operations of units.  For sure leaning towards the Gweiki..thanks",

    "comment_text": "I think there is a lot of nuance in getting the right laser cutter. The Polar looks like an interesting machine and I might be interested if I was getting something for my house. I'm a teacher and the Glowforge works best for my classroom. The footprint is just right for the classroom (looks similar to the Polar). The web interface is a selling point, allowing us to manage multiple users easily and not worry about software. I only use the interface to set up my cuts, where the camera is very useful. Everything else is done in Illustrator, Inkscape, or Vectornator. The subscription is completely optional and unnecessary. Respectfully, the review makes it sound almost required - that is simply incorrect. I have 5 Glowforges (the plus model). They are used constantly, the oldest being 3 years old, and I have never had a serious problem with any of them. Support was quick and helpful when an issue did present itself, the GF was cutting again by the end of the day. It is a no fuss machine - and that is what I need when working with 100 students each quarter. If I were buying a hobby machine I would have different requirements, but the Glowforge is pretty awesome for us. Just wanted to provide a different perspective/experience.",

The M1 spec states a 385x300mm (15x12 inch) working area, but is that the max size of the material sheet BEFORE cutting or just the max size of the cutting area?  For example, can I insert a sheet of 8mm MDF into the unit that is say 400x310mm and then design a shape to cut inside the 385x300 working area?  The reason I ask is that the shape I need to produce could be 300x300mm so it would be nice to be able to rough cut a slightly larger sheet to then make sure the finished shape can be cut out allowing for a small border.  Hope that makes sense?",

The second question is; when the lasers color mark on the stainless is it really laser annealing where the surface of the metal is not etched or is it true etching.  I need laser annealing because these stainless pieces will be used in hygienic applications where they need to be smooth and easy to clean.  Thank you!",
