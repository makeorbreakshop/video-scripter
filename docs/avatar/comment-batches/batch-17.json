I need to cut cardboard (not corrugated) thick ranging 0.5 mm - 5 mm ( that's max i think) and some wooden plywood (in some cases). Would you advice something with reasonable price (Say under 1 - 1.5K) ? I cannot justify spent 2k on device i use once a month or so.",

The factor that you didn't mention at all is likely the biggest factor to consider when making this decision... Serviceability.   While the K40 is obviously repairable, since it can be upgraded, it's my understanding that the Glowforge is not serviceable at all.  \n\nLast year I was considering buying a used Glowforge and found dozens for sale.  Thinking that anything bought used would likely at least need a new tube I looked into the cost of parts and the tube.  Turns out you can't buy parts or repair the machine on your own.  If your tube, or any other part, goes out then the only option is to ship the machine back to Glowforge and they will give you a discount on buying a new one.  I couldn't find any other service information so I opted to not get one.  \n\nIt's a truly  horrible policy that makes the Glowforge seem more like a scam than a ligament machine.  I hope that I either missed something or they fix the way they treat their customers.",

    "comment_text": "Good grief -- 40w -- good video, nice work as always -- I wish I had bought the X-tool.\n\nOrtur issues  info below:\n\nWell-Known Issues with Ortur Lasermaster 3: A Comprehensive Review\n\nIssue 1: Ortur LM-3 Not Powering On\nOne of the most prevalent problems encountered by users of the Ortur Laser Master 3 is its failure to power on. This issue can stem from various factors, including a faulty power adapter, blown fuse, loose connections, malfunctioning laser module, or motherboard glitches. Notably, the Ortur LM-3 has faced criticism for having an underpowered \"power brick.\" Despite seeking assistance for this issue, my attempts were met with silence. Subsequently, I discovered a suitable replacement on Amazon.\n\nIssue 2: Inadequate Laser Engraving\nWhen laser engravings fail to meet expectations, several causes might be at play. These include improper focus, uneven engraving area, or unsuitable materials for engraving.\n\nIssue 3: Mid-Operation Halts\nFrequent occurrences of the machine halting during operations can be attributed to loose connections, faulty motors, or software/firmware glitches. This issue has been highlighted extensively on YouTube.\n\nIssue 4: Subpar Engraving Quality\nSubstandard engraving quality can arise due to incorrect settings, a dirty lens, or a malfunctioning laser module. To rectify this, adjustments in settings, proper lens maintenance, and considering the laser module's condition are recommended.\n\nIssue 5: Smoke and Odor Production\nDuring operation, the machine emitting smoke or strong odors might be a result of a dirty lens, improper settings, or insufficient ventilation. This concern is commonplace among lasers, particularly during cutting. Installing proper external ventilation and employing an enclosed setup are advised solutions.\n\nIssue 6: Unusual Motor Noises\nMotors emitting abnormal sounds during operation may be attributed to loose connections, inadequate lubrication, or faulty motors. Similar observations have been shared on YouTube. A common cause was Ortur's inadequate tightening of drive sprocket set screws, resulting in loosening.\n\nIssue 7: SD Card Recognition Failure\nWhen the machine fails to recognize an SD card, possible reasons include a faulty SD card, corrupted files, or firmware complications. Contacting Ortur for assistance may lead to unresponsiveness, as evidenced by my own experience.\n\nIssue 8: Machine Freezing During Operation\nMachine freezing mid-operation may stem from software/firmware glitches, motherboard issues, or communication problems between the machine and the computer. Establishing a reliable link between my Ortur LM-3 and my computer proved to be a major struggle. Despite weeks of effort and assistance from Ortur, I ultimately sold my brand-new machine at a loss due to this issue.\n\nIssue 9: Inconsistent Engravings\nInconsistent engraving results might result from incorrect settings, a dirty lens, problematic materials, or a malfunctioning PWM (pulse width modulated) laser power controller. Obtaining assistance from Ortur for this issue was often challenging.\n\nLack of Customer Support and Service\nIn terms of customer service and support, Ortur falls significantly short. Despite purchasing their hardware, I received no aid when problems arose. Requests for help went unanswered, and defective parts were disregarded. Unfortunately, Ortur seems unwilling to invest in its customers' needs or satisfaction.\n\nPersonal Experience with Ortur LM-3\nMy excitement for the Ortur Laser Master 3's potential to enhance my workshop quickly turned to disappointment and frustration. Despite its promising appearance, I encountered only obstacles and minimal assistance from Ortur. Their lone response directed me elsewhere for help. Ultimately, after exhausting various resources without resolution, I was forced to sell the Ortur LM-3 at a substantial loss, leading to the demise of my aspirations.\n\nAn Urgent Recommendation\nGiven my ordeal, I strongly advise considering alternative options before investing in an Ortur product. It is my hope that you avoid supporting a company that displays such an evident lack of commitment to both product quality and \ncustomer service.\n\nParting Thoughts\nI am not inclined to write negative reviews, but I felt compelled to share my experience as a cautionary tale for others. Thank you for taking the time to read my account, and I sincerely wish you success in your pursuit of a laser product that truly meets your expectations.",

Reputable companies (J-Tech Photonics and Gweike Cloud, for example) do not do this. Yes, Atomstack buries an optical output power deep in their text, but I wouldn't trust it to be accurate given how dishonest they are in the rest of their advertising (for example, 48W for the X40 MAX is **obvious** BS to anyone familiar with diode lasers). In my opinion, we should boycott all laser manufacturers that even mention the power consumption, given how much it misleads many buyers. And, I want to see them show the ACTUAL laser output power being measured with a power meter (again, J-Tech and Gweike Cloud do this).",

I recently bought an AF2028-60 from them. When it arrived it was instead a usb-0705-u1. Instead of the 600mm/s time of the machine advertised, it was  listed at 500mm/s. I contacted customer service and they said I got an upgraded model. But if so why is it slower. It seems more likely to me someone either screwed up or sent me an older model and thought I wouldn't notice. Any advice you've got would be appreciated. Love your channel by the way.",

    "comment_text": "+50% $ for an upgraded machine sounds great. \n+100% $ sounds justifiable if the quality/features are there.\n+250% $ is way too hard to justify IMO. You could buy 2 of the OMTech lasers + 5 Extra 60w tubes that will last you the next 20 years for that price. And the Thunder has a smaller build volume and no camera? I like that they're trying to make a more premium Chinese laser but I think it's an oversight to not at least include the features of the competitors that are less than half the price.",

Paid $2000 delivered, earned probably $6000 with it already. All these machines that you test are just fancy toy machines for people who know nothing about technology really. Hardly upgradable too. That tiny area is probably barely going to cover needs of a housewife, and don't even get me started of how much these companies are charging hamsters for their K40 $300 equivalent toys. If I wanted to spend a $3000+ on a CO2 laser, I would just build a freaking servo driven 150W  1m2 monster. They way people waste money is just hilarious. I mean, same people buy carton sheds in usa for $500000, what can you expect from them after that lol. The only thing I truly hate about all industrial lasers is a very stupid controller and a software, RUIDA controllers absolutely suck and they are supposedly the best around, so everything else is even worse apparently. I'd love to have some opensource FW options to be able to tinker and add more features to industrial lasers.",

But. further on in their spec sheet they say it comes with a 12v 5 Amp power supply.... eye roll.... yes, that is a 60 watt power supply.... so I really don't know where they get 130W from.... Anyway, it is their spec, you are being true to what they give out.      On the co2 equivalent, the Epilog 75watt I had use of for a few years, required 240v and required a 15A circuit, so perhaps they should say it was a 3.6 Kilowatt machine.... I must say though, I am pretty impressed by these little laser machines, and they do some stuff better than a co2, just slower",

I'm not that familiar with lasers - I have had an Ortur LM3 for some months now and become pretty comfortable with it. I use Lightburn and see that little switch in the layers tab for \"Air\". Not sure if that's a thing that is ever used with the cheaper lasers. Or, honestly, even the larger ones. I've never used a CO2 laser. I've found I get much better engraving results (or at least have to sand a lot less) if I don't use air for my engraving, or I use really minimal air. Really dig the channel and reviews. Thanks 🙂",

    "comment_text": "Atomstack now also have an upgraded controller that you can use with LightBurn to control the air assist (on/off). I agree that handpad is useless. One thing I never see mentioned is diode laser life. My x20 has reduced in power by about a third (according to my cut tests) with only 10s of hours on it. It's not a dirty lens/lens protector or S30 setting issue. They have agreed for me to send it back (after copious amounts of poor and repetitive formulaic email support). On the whole I'm not impressed with the build quality. The focus adjustment is sloppy (the addon z-height adjuster requires moving the M2.5 tapped holes for a limit switch), my x-axis eccentric nut was over tightened at the factory which damaged the v-wheels and I had to replace them. The cable management is poor. My next laser is going to be the Roly 20 or 40W. The Roly10W build quality is amazing and their tech support is first class.",

But after reading the manual, im super scared of random reflections from the laser bouncing out of the engraver. The manual says to always wear glasses, is it really necessary? I thought I would be able to look through the glass lid while the machine is engraving ... Do I only need glasses for this? What if I open up the tray and use the pass through, or the rotary tool, does the opening at the front of the laser leave me susceptible to laser reflections and  possible burns or blindness? I know it may seem like i'm being overly paranoid, but these are the things the warning labels talk about, yet I see people operate them online as if closing the lid is more than enough. I even saw one man stoop down and get eye level with the laser as it engraved a glass cup, the front of the engraver was exposed and open. I'm a complete novice and have no basis as to what is normal to do or not to do. I would truly appreciate your insight on this.",
