Does the large white fan somehow also provide air assist? \n\nSecondly, on the \"supplemental\" air assist, you've connected a fairly low output aquarium pump. Does the built in air assist provide less \"assist\" than the pump you showed??\n\nThanks!",

    "comment_text": "I never post any reviews. I just want people to be aware of how hard it is to get a hold of someone in the company. I have an issue with my laser firing. They told me that usually its the hinge on the machine that collects debris causing the laser not to fire. This worked for maybe 2-3 cuts. I am back to the same problem. Now, the machine no longer fires. The machine homes and \"enables laser\" but not light when framing the project. When I disable fan and hit start, the machine acts like it is firing. I am following the instructions word for word. I have checked the settings. I have reinstalled the software. Looked the FAQ. I have emailed, called and left messages, and did the online chat.  The team seems really nice. I would just like someone to get in touch with me to trouble shoot. I am willing to send my machine back and have them fix it.   I can't recommend this product because the customer service is subpar. I just wanted to make a gift for my two year old. I am happy to update this if I ever get a hold of them.",

    "comment_text": "I‚Äôve had my eye on the Aeon Mira 5S Redline, and I have a few questions regarding my product line that I plan to work with. I want to make sure the machine fits my specific needs, so I‚Äôm hoping you can provide some insights.\r\n\r\n1. Can the engraving and cutting height be automatically adjusted to uneven surfaces (e.g., wavy materials)? Ideally, I‚Äôd like a 3D mapping system where I can freely define the measurement points based on the material. I‚Äôd like to set the number of measurement points per square cm or at least define a measurement area to ensure the engraving or 3D map is as accurate as possible.\r\n\r\n2. Is there an automated height detection system or any add-ons for soft materials like leaves or flowers, which are difficult to measure with mechanical height detection?\r\n\r\n3. What is the noise level of the machine and the exhaust system? I plan to use it in my home, so that‚Äôs important for me.\r\n\r\n4. When working with larger materials that are fed through the machine, is it possible for the engraving or cutting to be automatically detected and seamlessly extended? I‚Äôm looking for intelligent software that can adjust the engraving path automatically without needing to manually realign the material.\r\n\r\n5. Do you use or recommend any infeed track with a stopper and optional conveyor belt for precise material alignment and consistent movement at the right angle during the process?\r\n\r\n6. Is there an intelligent function for engraving multiple identical materials? I would like the machine to detect and optimize the engraving process across multiple pieces with identical designs, to save time and ensure consistent results.\n\nI know that the xTool P2S has most of the features I need, and their software is actually quite good. However, it seems that they may have purchased reviews on Trustpilot, and their customer support has been quite disappointing, so I don‚Äôt fully trust this company.\n\nI‚Äôm also interested in experimenting with inlays in small QR codes, around 30x30mm, where the glass tube CO2 laser might reach its limits. It could be better to go for an RF option, but I‚Äôm not sure if Aeon is the right choice for this. You may have a better idea of what would suit my needs best, considering you‚Äôve tested a larger product range and are up to date with the latest technologies.\n\nI‚Äôm based in Germany, so it would be good if there aren‚Äôt any issues with shipping or customer support, but that‚Äôs mostly optional.\n\nBest regards",

    "comment_text": "From what I've gathered, the fully enclosed hobby level diode machines with a camera, air assist and at least 20W of power cost in the 1200-1500 range. This is comparable to lower end CO2 machines. So why not just get the CO2? Well, for one, the cut quality seems to be cleaner with a diode laser, as they usually have smaller kerf and are consistent across the entire work area. The versatility of light cutting up to 15mm and more detailed engraving in a single machine is probably a better option for hobbyists than a small CO2 laser. Or am I wrong and there are CO2 lasers that outperform the engraving quality of diodes?",

You find out really quick how limited the machine is and how poorly built it is (wobbly legs, wobbly laser module, cords barely plug in, airflow is horrid making it shut down every 20-30min). After about 2 months I put it under a shelf in my building and haven't touched it since. Creality is an FDM printer company just trying to stay relevant so their support on their lasers are non-existent. Maybe I got a dud, but my friend bought one as well and had a similar experience. I know it's a cheap entry level laser, but I have a hard time supporting a $500+ paperweight.",

The most difficult part for me has been to accurately align the honeycomb to the frame and  spoilboard(s), and then aligning the objects to be engraved/cut.

The machines run 2-3 hours a day just about everyday. As problems arise I do my best to troubleshoot and put out fires but this is getting harder and harder.  I've convinced my admin that I am going to need to replace one of both of these machines soon. I am DEFINITELY NOT going with Glowforge again.

I unboxed it, bought a couple \"improved\" nozzle assemblies, and the Ruika Controller from Cam Edmonds and then never even turned it on! Luckily I was able to sell it for about 80% of what I had in it. So, the OneLaser XRF will be my first laser. I'll be looking forward to your upcoming Thursday Live again.

Is that needed, or does the small fan in the laser do enough? 10w would be good enough to small cutting? I don't mind taking a few passes. \n\nAnd the boss laser has an air fan in there, would this just be ok next to an open window and an exhaust fan? I'm thinking about fumes or smoke. \n\nThanks for your great channel!",

I think Xtool appeals to more people because of the ease of use/software and their 3d mapping for curved surfaces. A little learning curve with Lightburn but being new to engraving, its not that bad IMO. Watch a few videos and you are good to go.\n\nI am curious about the noise of the base unit laser one. How loud is it in decibels? How loud when you add in the air assist? Also what type of maintenance is needed for the laser one (weekly, monthly? your recommendations). Also a quick run down for new people like me on what materials you can use with it would have been nice (but I can check the website for that). \n\nI'm looking at getting a laser this Jan or Feb. Considered Roly Lasermatic (larger version) and Xtool but this looks really nice. Will definitely put this on my list as a product to watch.",

Does not always happen.. but just curious what in the world could be going on.. the depth of the engraving is just not consistent ...Air assist is off and over scanning at 2.5%.. could this be something in the \"Common settings\" Maybe the scan angle? the image is in 3 layers..but the setting are the same in all layers..   The layers starts good but then changes occur and you see deeper areas then the rest on that particular layer... Even when i join the entire file as one layer after i group it together..  I aways burn the same image, just change the text in it.. anyone here have any thoughts? thanx.",

Looking forward to the actual performance of the OneLaser XRT, they advertise 3D Photerealistic accuracy and would like to some before pushing the button.  I was looking at CO2 lasers upgrading from a 10W diode to expand capabilities, big step. I like the fact that the RF, though more expensive, doesn't require the additional cooling requirement in comparing to the CO2 machines.  You mentioned the 3-2-1 warranty, does that mean should the fan on the RF tube or tube itself faults that there is a 3yr warranty on it?  Thanks again for all the great videos and reviews.",

(1)  If I start out with the desktop model, would you suggest that I start out with the glass tube chiller model or the RF model?  Being a NEWBIE, I want to make the right decision.  (2) Then, the Hydra unit ... the 700 model does not come with a pass through option? Please advise. Thanks!",

    "comment_text": "Great reviews, and thanks for the details !  I‚Äôm totally on board with this ranking. \n\nI had a Polar before‚Äîit worked fine at first, but quickly turned into a disaster. The inside of the machine? Constantly filthy. You have to clean the lens every couple of hours to keep it from getting scorched, and the build quality is‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs just say, not great. I‚Äôve spent so much time on fixing shit, dat I could‚Äôve paid for a whole new machine by now. And customer service? Practically nonexistent. They pass you around, and might call back two weeks later, right after you‚Äôve DIY-fixed the issues.\n\nThe P2S was my top pick‚Äînot just for the minor upgrades, but mostly for the bed size (23.6‚Äù x 12‚Äù) and speed. And let‚Äôs be real‚Äîtheir ads are literally everywhere. You can‚Äôt escape them! This company must have piles of cash to burn; it‚Äôs insane how much they‚Äôre pouring into marketing. There are other niche brands like Bolt and Mira, but their bed sizes are too small for my needs, and the pricing is all over the place. Then I saw the ONELASER X, launching right after the P2S, and this new brand checked all my boxes: a bigger bed size (26‚Äù x 14‚Äù), excellent build quality, twice the speed, a clean cabinet design with an enclosed base, and full US-based support., Honestly, I was nervous about going with a new brand, but now I‚Äôm convinced I made the right choice.\n\nHopefully, OneLaser ships my order on time‚Äîbecause that‚Äôs the important part they can‚Äôt afford to mess up! I mean that seriously.",

I really appreciated the clear, up-close views and detailed breakdown, especially around items to consider ordering to be prepared for the machine‚Äôs arrival. I'm glad you suggested getting the air assist, setting up proper ventilation, and preparing for fume management. Thanks for the excellent insights‚ÄîI‚Äôm looking forward to working with this machine!\n\nOne of the most innovative features, and something I find especially valuable, is the built-in air quality indicator. This sensor is a game changer, allowing real-time air quality monitoring, which is particularly helpful in a closed room with only a window for ventilation. I had been considering purchasing a separate air quality sensor, so having this integrated feature is a fantastic benefit. Given that a lot of our work can produce strong odors, seeing an indicator for particle levels is very helpful for health and safety.",
