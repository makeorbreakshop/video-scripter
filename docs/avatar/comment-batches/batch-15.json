It is a 7W diode that I will be upgrading to 10W soon on a approximately 5 ft x 5 ft frame (about 1400mm squared actual work space).  My other half and sister in law do a lot of sewn products for people, and being able to laser cut when you need 50 of the same pattern cut at a time is a huge timesaver.  It cost me around $1000 in parts to build plus a lot of time, but even a diode unit that large would be a few thousand dollars minimum.  I could have dropped that price by 3d printing more parts instead of using aluminum for 99% of the machine.\n\nI recognize that is not a good option for most people though.",

I had pretty much decided on the Atomstack A5 Pro until I saw this video, and so glad I did!  The question I have is, can you please clarify the differences, if any, in the Atomstack models X7, A10, and S10?  I'm getting conflicting information from sellers.  Some say there is no difference in the three except for the color of the unit.  Another says \"S10 Pro is improved performance in all aspects than X7, also it can engraving material including wood, glass, stainless steel, acrylic, etc. and with faster speed and more better results.  This will be a better choice for all engraving and cutting enthusiasts.\"  My head is spinning and I figure if anyone can get to the bottom of this, you can!  :)  Thank you!!",

A 3-hour project will now take 12 hours which is huge if you have to stand watching the machine (as most hobby users do). Not to mention the extra power usage...\n\nThey made 4 and 5 axis hobby cnc machines useless by removing that functionality completely. This limits what you can make regardless if it's a one-off hobby job or full production. \n\nManual tool changes have been made needlessly arduous as they now require a whole new operation.\n\nThey could have achieved the stated goal by simply limiting the hobby version to only posting to Mach 3 and Linuxcnc which no commercial VMCs use. \n\nMost of what they removed has nothing to do with commercial operations. It looks more aimed at forcing hobby users to pay for expensive subscriptions for the small handful of personal projects they do.",

I don’t want to buy one only to realize I need a bigger one etc. I also don’t want to buy industrial only to get bored with producing products. I don’t mind spending 20-25K setting up shop with tools that I will need to do the work correctly. I do have a bunch of carpenter tools for rough work but nothing really for finish work. So I will continue my research in what tools I will need to enter into this field. Now having said that, I am impressed so far with the Glowforge Pro Laser Cutter. Will that be my first purchase? I don’t know. I want to check out your other reviews as well as other folks reviews on the different brands. I will also be looking if someone did a video on complete tools to setup a shop needed. This machine sounds pretty simple and that’s good for an old guy like me. If you have any suggestions or links I will check them out. Thank you.",

As recently as 9 months ago, xTool was heavily promoting their D1 and D1 Pro lasers, yet if one visits their site now, ALL of the replacement parts are \"out of stock\", and none of the laser heads can be replaced, with the exception of the $1,200 40w head for the D1 Pro.\n\nSo if your machine breaks, be aware you cannot get parts to repair it. This seems to be true for all xTool products, and I think a 2 year (maximum) service life is preposterous for a tool at this price-point.",
