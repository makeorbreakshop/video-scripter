Absolutely not made for professional use and even less for private use. Way too loud, poor cooling, extremely difficult to maintain if something breaks. And the worst part: the exhaust. When you use this laser, everything smells. It’s not sealed. This laser is far too expensive, and I would always prefer the Turbo 535 from Omtech. This laser is a marketing gimmick and not recommended.",

The camera will always move a tiny bit out of calibration.\nNot only that, but even if you really mount it as sturdy as possible and have the same thickness of material all the time, it will just by itself loose calibration within 2-3 runs.\nNot only that, even if you use fixed jigs (no camera), the laser itself isn't consistent in positioning, you may get 2-5mm shifts randomly.\n\nSo all in all the Lightburn camera alignment feature is just a collosal disappointment.\n\nIs that what you show in the video - randomly positioned material with accurate detection and accurate positioning - REALLY REALLY reality or is that staged B.S.? Does it REALLY get the content onto the material in the right angle, in the right place?\nCan there be a proper review of this feature, please?\n\nThanks!",

Lasering is often a a smoky messy process,  the inside of a laser cutter needs a lot of cleaning.     It might be challenging to keep the sort of clean room environment you want for cloth and paper in the same environment with laser cutting.",

The crafter machines are getting multifunctional with printing/blade cutting modules, while the hobby ones focus on lasers.\n\nInstead of having an always ticked \"enclosure\" column, you should add important parameters missing from your sheet:\n* how the focus works: by moving the module or bed - as this limits functionality, you can't easily do curved surface processing when the whole bed has to move up and down\n* rotary attachment support - out of the box, with optional riser base, etc.\n* pass through / removable bottom plate\n\nBTW as far as I know WeCreat somehow shot off xTool (ex employees?) - their software is basically a clone of xCS 1.x.\nBTW2 you could have waited with this until the P2S review.",

They were SUPER helpful for learning and mastering Lightburn, but I was wondering if you are planning on doing any more that are specific to the Polar. I haven't found anyone else on youtube who is as easy to follow as you and who is covering the polar. This isn't our first rodeo- our main laser is an old beast from a defunct company in China, but sometimes all the bells and whistles are almost more complicated. I'd love to see videos on the camera, or more explaining how to use the z axis. I've got engraving down, but we're struggling with cutting through material in a reliable way. Thank you for all the videos you made so far!",

When I did auto trace, it traces both sides of the lines of the bit map design, which causes the laser to cut line, then cut again a fraction over. I thought it was mistakenly set to more than one pass, but it wasn’t. I zoomed in and that’s when I saw that auto trace ended up tracing both sides of the single lines.  Is there anyway to keep it from tracing both sides of one line? Ok, sorry, I’m sure that didn’t make much sense.  🤷‍♂️",
