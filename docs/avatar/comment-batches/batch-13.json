    "comment_text": "Interesting video, thanks for sharing your thoughts on lasers. I'm very surprised you picked Glowforge above all other desktop lasers. \n\nHaving used both the Glowforge and others, the only benefit to Glowforge is ease of getting started.  The native Glowforge software is a bit easier to use, but it is also feature poor. They also hobble the software unless you pay a monthly subscription fee. \n\nOther drawbacks include - cleaning the Glowforge is more difficult, and the laser is underpowered for the price. Most importantly, and most hidden from the customer, - their support is weak at best; they are slow to respond to issues, if they ever do; and they don't really sell key replacement parts for wear and tear, instead they want you to ship your machine back and purchase a refurbished device for all but the smallest issues. \n\nOh, and  you have to upload your designs to their cloud based service, meaning you can't print if your internet is offline and they can monitor what you print on your machine.",

I watched the reviews on the muse, and some others. Basically I have narrowed it down to this X tool and the muse. I know the price difference is huge.\n\nIt looks like the X tool has a better rotary attachment. But the muse is obviously a little higher quality. I would just be starting out would you suggest a diode or CO2? Specifically one of these two machines. I guess the main thing that these would be used for is designs on leather and tumblers/cups. Any advice would be Appreciated. Thanks advance.",

It appears that at the moment the 2S has been replaced by the 3Max but has the same laser equipment, or am I wrong?  Also, just an idea on review: in the RC community there are a lot of people that build their own aircraft from scratch (Balsa and plywood 3mm) and need to cut the wood with precision.  Which machine would you recommend or such a job?  knowing that the CO2 lasers are deemed a bit too expensive and too small for that use.  My idea was to look at the Neje 3 max as it has a nice big surface to work with but the question remains about how much power do you really need? is it the 5,5 or 6, 10 or even the 12W version.  If possible I would like to get you take on this?  Again thanks for all your reviews!!",

I have a Millright Mega V XXL that came with a 4th axis and for $2300 you can buy the Mega V with a 4th and mill Aluminium..\nThe Snapmaker is an intresting machine but I feel that bed is just letting it down",

From what I’ve seen it’s a good machine.  I also love the modular design, and sealed parts with rugged cables.\n\nMy main complaint is that it’s not open source, granted they have fears of copycats i guess?  Maybe they could do something like open source the last generation each time they make a new one?\n\nI’m excited to see the one in it’s printing, because a locked down extruder/nozzle ecosystem is a concern i have not knowing much about this.\n\nAlso selling “toolplates” so you could make a drag knife (or knife + servos for turning with the cut), or marker, or even EDM module would be really cool.  I think one channel has made their own pen  holder for the snapmaker.  Open Sourcing the standard could help toolhead development too.\n\nI guess in conclusion if they could open source it, and/or get the cost of the rotary+enclosure+machine down to maybe 1,000-1,500 USD or so it would be top tier of “first 3d printer” category, not just “best all in one machine”!  But as of now that all in one aspect is it’s only real plus i guess.",

    "comment_text": "\"15 watt\" laser? This is true. The laser manufacturers are taking the idea of running electronics at a lower power to lengthen their lives. GE used to do that with incandescent lifebulbs - they would manufacture the bulbs to run at 130v AC so that when we used them at normal household voltage (110-120) the bulbs would last a lot longer than typical bulbs. So NEJE is doing the same with their modules - building them with 15 watt, but driving them to produce 10.5 -11 watt output. So even if you run them at 100% for long projects, the laser will still continue to produce full power and have a decent lifespan. I have been reading how a few laser users are finding out that their lesser well-designed lasers would die soon after a project that required their lasers to run at 100% for an extended period of time. This is why NEJE, Atomstack and  other laser manufacturers are doing this \"underpowering\" their laser modules to extend their lives. They use 7.5 watt laser diodes and only force them to deliver 5 Watts. The dual diodes are 7.5 diodes x2, each powered to produce about 5.5 Watts each to result in a 10-12 watt laser, depending on the manufacturer. These NEW modules are typically rated with 20, 000 hour life spans.",

    "comment_text": "I’ve been using my T250 for about a month now. I’ve found it to be a way better printer than my Ender 3 V2, easy to set up, easy to calibrate and much more even bed heating. I’ve found it way easier to get consistent layering and I haven’t had a print come loose yet. Once you get the work flow down swapping between modes is about 5 minutes work. Laser works well for engraving and cuts 2mm birch,  it it’s slow. Luban works well very well if you’re just doing something straight forward. \n\nMy assessment, it’s much easier to get started, get making and get consistent results with this than my Ender. I enjoy using the snapmaker and feel like I get to focus on the project not the machine. My first month with the ender was an endless series of failed prints, great learning experience but at times quite discouraging. First time I booted up the SM, it auto calibrated, I dropped the print head 0.5mm, hit print and got a perfect print of a model I was still failing to get on the Ender after a half dozen attempts.\n\nFor the hardcore 3D printers out there perhaps the bang for the buck is low, for the rest of us this is great",

I also 3d printed accessories  for pen (for plotter art) and a drag knife for cutting vinyl. No complaints here. A lot of the issues I see people complaining are more about all the things you need to know not get a good 3d print like calibration or filament humidity, all things you have to learn to get good results.",

    "comment_text": "I have one. I hate it, and I truly wish I had bought a D1, cheap CNC, and upgraded a few of my enders. Would have saved me a lot of time and money. \n\nSo within a week of opening the machine, I reached out to Snapmaker for support concerning the laser function. Turns out the guy I got stuck with didn't know what he was talking about. He told me it was broken, and I was then jacked around for 3 months before they stopped replying at all. 3 months later (6 months in total) They reach back out to me concerning a negative review I left on a third party site.  I used their contact to start trying to get help from them again, only to find out the problem I originally had is a limitation of the machine itself. Camera capture cannot accurately capture tall items  (3-4\" tall) for engraving. It just cuts out massive sections of the image. So 6 months, countless hours of time, and countless materials wasted trying to fix a machine that they said was broken... that wasn't. \n\nThey also removed my negative review from their site, and tried to bribe me into taking down my third party site review. \n\nI did end up getting a 50% refund, but that was because I was prepared to dispute the charges with Paypal. It's an ok, non upgradeable 3D printer. It's not a Prusa, or even an Ender. Haven't had a chance to play with the CNC yet, as the machine is noisy enough on its own. \n\nMy review stands, and I'll continue to tell everyone about my experiences. The machine is meh, and the support is crap.",

In the Neje wiki documentation I've found that they recommend setting it at a focal distance of about 33mm for engraving and about 55mm for cutting (18mm ply?!?).  You have to unscrew the lens about 7 full rotations from it's fully 'closed' or seated position against the upper housing for engraving but it definitely produces a finer spot. \n\nMy USB microscope doesn't have a measurement tool but from my very rough estimate, it looks like I can get a line width of around .12 when setup for the 'engraving'  focal distance.\n\nI'm sure folks would appreciate your more seasoned look at it - especially as you call it out as having a bigger dot width, which may not be entirely accurate given the configuration options. \n\nI hope this observation comes across in the most positive light,  I really appreciate all videos and your calibration methods - super helpful for someone new to the technology! Keep up the great work!!",

The hole in the nozzle where the laser and air comes through is about 1.5mm in diameter and maybe about 3mm above the focal point so the stream of air is getting right into the cut.",

These diode laser are great TOYS yes toys... they are great sweet toys to learn laser cutting to use Lightburn but they are absolutely unusable to anything serious. After half year I bought a 50W CO2 laser and the difference is DAY and NIGHT. If you want to cut out anything complicated with a diode laser you have to wait 2-3 hours... the CO2 is exactly 10X faster which is a LOT. Without air assist and what is even more important without smoke sucking!!!!  People cannot imagine how much smoke these machines generate, you cannot stay in the same room if you are cutting wood or plastic for longer times..... Soo please people don't believe anybody if you really want to cut than save up for a CO2 machine. (Yes I know it cost 6-7X more but it worth it) These diode lasers are a waist of money... and no they will not be stronger the two diode versions are quite expensive with 10W makes the CO2 almost cheap. Only one thing which is slightly better with the diode laser is the the kerf (cutting width) is slightly smaller (but also not circular but like rectangle). Think long term go with CO2...",
