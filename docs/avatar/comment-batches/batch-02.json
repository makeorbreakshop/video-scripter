    "comment_text": "Bought a Full Spectrum 18 x 24 machine 3-1/2 years ago at approx. $9,000. Had to replace laser 8 month later. ($600) 2-1/2 years old and Main processor and power supply failed. Called F.S. and got nothing. They had stopped making the main control board and offered NO assistance. Bought a new power supply and Main processor from Light Object and got machine back up and running. Quite different software to learn, but, now I prefer it. I CAN'T recommend F.S. for their customer service or warranty. Just had to replace an axis driver. Another $50 gone! Please do your OWN research!",

And finally, if the answer to my initial question is no, can I purchase upgrades for it that can cut through 0.3 mm hardwood veneer?\n\nThank you for your time in answering this for me.

I saw your review of the Ortur, and I can get one with a little more powerful laser. (20W instead of the 15W, which as you pointed out is really like 6 watts vs. 4 watts) Do you think that will do the job? Thank so much!",

For what I am looking to do and for the tiny budget I have it will be the right way to go. I'm upgrading it to a 150w and it's a good size (900x600mm) cutting area. I would love to get into cutting metal but will have to wait until I can afford a fiber cutter I guess. Thanks for the video, helped heaps!",

I am worried about making the same mistake. The poly looked horrible, i think we used a minwax Oil based poly, on top of my Kona Gel stain .. .I think we did the same thing with the stain i didnt let it sit long enough and wiped to much off. it looked nice in the begging but the next day it was faded quit a bit. But it wasn't that bad., WE covered it with some poly and it was horrible looking made it look faded even more??? no idea why? I put down a the butcher block oil on the butcher block before staining not a oil based pre stain. I have no idea but i am looking for idea on what to cover my stain with, i do NOT LIKE POLY at all. It was so plastic looking and showed so much flaws along with looking cloudy. .",

    "comment_text": "nice review....when $ is no object....My advice for anyone is read reviews and watch a lot...a lot of videos. Then so you dont throw your $ in the ocean....buy a K40 laser. Ya i know, its chinese, its unsafe, etc, etc..... you dont have to be a rocket scientist with these....i bought one on amazon, did a tweek here and there. I use inkscape (free)....and scorchworks (free) to use this K40 laser, and it works great....dont have to deal with chinese software.... you learn alot, the cost is super minumum.... if you dont like it, or you get bored with it, sell it on craigslist for  $200....lesson learned.\nsooooo. to wrap things up.....Couple years ago, i built my own. bigger and better c02 laser and still using free software. Cost me $1500 to make, and i have more than made up the cost to make it.....life treating me fine right now....retired. Learned off the K40, reading reviews, watching you-tube videos......then make your own.....cant tell you how many people have made their own.....a ton.",

    "comment_text": "Nice video. Wish you focused more on the higher end lasers but not really your target audience and not something you have in the shop. I wouldn't put boss anywhere near epilog. \nFor general use CO2 lasers I would do a list like this:\n- K40 + upgrades\n- 50W ebay/ali chinese\n- 80W ebay/ai chinese\n- All in ones or what you call kickstarter lasers (including the more expensive dremel brand one)\n- Branded chinese lasers with local support (boss, thunder, aeon etc)\n- Finally top tier RF lasers (epilog, trotec, ULS etc)\nThere's plenty of specific machines that fall outside those categories. Like aeon having an 'all in one' style series and thunder laser having RF source lasers.",

I use it for plans to accompany my videos and for client pitches to give everyone a clear understanding of exactly what will be produced. Now that I‚Äôm somewhat proficient in sketchup, of course, they make the announcement that it will no longer be free in the near future, so it seems like Fusion will be the way to go. I‚Äôve heard a few folks plugging your new 360 course and since folks who get my plans won‚Äôt even be able to view the models for free, it‚Äôs looking like I‚Äôll be making the switch in the near future.",
