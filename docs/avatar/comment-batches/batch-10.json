    "comment_text": "Ok i was just using TinkerCad and noticed there was ALOT of limitations but that is expected on a WEB BASED 3D MODELING... I mean come on.. So i looked in to FUSION360.. and since im a bit older.. i can tell you how i felt reading the changes even years after it happened.\n\nYall remember Photoshop? Like every single person on the planet knew of and used photoshop at least a few times in their lives.\nThen they did the cloud thing.. and guess what.. NO ONE uses photoshop anymore except their super rich nich businesses that already havent moved on to other technology.\n\nThats the vibe I get. Autodesk was something of a community of free users improving their help and tutorials and user interface. Everyone knew what autodesk was even if you never used its software. \nThey will go 100% cloud and be premium for a insane priceing stradegy only to attract the richest of the rich customers all while making their name on the free version no longer offered.\n\nFU Autodesk\n\nMoving on to something else before i get used to your software then you take it away and charge $2600 a year.",

I assume they only offer a low power laser to keep cost down, and if you're looking to cut something, why not use the CNC function? \nI'd really like to see you review the Genmitsu 4030, which seems to have pretty solid build quality for the price and plenty of add-ons like extension rails to massively increase the work area and a 10W laser that would give you 2/3 of these functions, but very possibly provide much more superior performance for the same cost.",

    "comment_text": "I just got mine yesterday and came from glowforge so was super nervous about how user friendly it would be. Everything worked great out of the box- I followed Cam’s setup instructions. I had a couple initial hiccups running it with my Mac (no usb and I needed a usb to usb c conversion and then still my Mac not recognizing it for whatever reasons and next trying to run it through a gfci outlet was a no go and still trying to figure out Wi-Fi/Ethernet connection stuff). But now running lightburn on my daughter’s pc it is working great. Much more powerful /fast/capable than my glowforge plus and wow for the price. If you follow the unboxing and setup videos that are on YouTube, read the manual thoroughly, then it doesn’t take long to understand it and get running. TBD if I can get my Mac to recognize it. Also 7mm hold down pins was my first cut and that appears to be the sweet spot",

I'm looking for a machine I can grow with and learn more about as well as do the typical beginner stuff.)  Thank you!!",

    "comment_text": "Glowforge is a compete pos. Prior to buying my 50w Omtech, I rented a Glowforge from a friend, and it was 100% unusable because you HAVE TO scan the bed with the camera prior to every burn. So, if you think you’re going to design something and pound a bunch of them out, 1 after the other, you’re going to be seriously disappointed. It makes no difference that every piece is on exactly the same material and there is no need to scan every time. You HAVE TO. Their software is crap and replacement parts are more trouble than their worth.\n\nI had a Lightburn camera on my Omtech. I took it out and threw it away. I can’t imagine what could possibly be the use for something so wildly inaccurate, and that’s after having spent far too much time mastering the calibration procedure. I’d disagree with the statement that Omtech support is great. It’s not. I had an issue with a loose X axis belt. I spent several days going back and forth with them and their suggestions for what to do had nothing - literally zero - to do with the problem, which was a loose belt. I figured it out on my own. Aside from that, I’ve been VERY happy with the machine and I’m coming up on a year of using it for production manufacturing.",

Good money, just have to go visit the bar, talk with the owner and show him a product. If he likes it, it's a very easy sell. Especially if they can give you their store logo art work to put on the top. It's kind of branding the bar so to speak. That is my secret business lol, wasn't trying to advertise it but its ok, it's not original,  just business",

Researching petroglyphs in Southwest USA turned up two designs created by uncredited authors being sold on mugs, tshirts, woodcraft, metal craft, etc. by at least 10 different sellers... as their own work. This crap is rampant. I can find tshirts with readily available art work being sold at discount stores all over the metro. One guy on youtube publishes a design build, and viewers complain when he doesn't make dimensions or code available.  When a creator does publish build files, code, etc., you can subsequently find that design being sold online as some douche's original work.\n\nSome people are actual creators. Everyone else seems to be ripoff artists.",

    "comment_text": "1:25 and even if you don't have a table saw you can just plane it by hand. No need to buy all kinds of powertools.\n1:55 dowels are optional. They can help against slippage while gluing, maybe even make the joints marginally stronger, but you don't actually need them.\n2:20 this is actually nonsense. If you alternate the directions you're going to get a wavy surface. You're averaging out the warping, but not stopping the warping. If you keep them all in one direction and make sure it wants to bow in an upward arch, if you then fasten the middle securely the entire rail the top rests on will stop it from warping altogether (that is, unless there's so much force the fastening doesn't hold, but you shouldn't get such moisture extremes indoors).\n40:20 you did the breadboard wrong. In the board itself you can just drill holes, but the part it slides over can only have a normal drill hole in the middle (to keep the breadboard centered). The other holes need to be elongated slots rather than just holes, so the pins going through them have room to move sideways (but not length wise obviously). Just a few millimeters, but what you've done now is basically the same as screwing the board on. This creates stress. Also, there's no need to glue it in the middle. You can, but you should glue less wide than you did. Just a bit around the centre pin.\n 4:20 yup, you need to practice planing. Especially sharpening your plane. Make it sharp, slightly round the corners, use a shallow setting, work methodically, and you won't have marks. Also, you need to check whether the sole of your plane is flat. \n\nGood on you for keeping practicing and wanting to learn!",

But once you find the height, measure it with calipers.  Then make a block that height--in my case, I 3D printed a simple rectangular block, was able to get within 0.05mm of the desired height, I think.  Then, if you want to etch, place your block on top of the etching surface, and let the laser module rest on the block while tightening.  If you want to burn, set your block on the empty honeycomb (or whatever sacrificial surface), and let the module rest on the block while tightening--remove the block and insert your material to burn.  This puts the focal length at the bottom of the material.  Note, this only works for up to a few millimeters of material.",

One thing I would have loved to have heard from you is what the main differences between a diode-based machine and a co2-based machine. I know you touched on diodes are more “beginner/budget”, and more compact and portable, but what are the pros and cons of each? Who’s the audience for each platform? And why would a diode be a better fit for this type of person, be a co2? And visa versa? I get that typically a co2 machine has a bigger work area, but I can’t image that’s the only benefit of going the co2-based route. Thoughts?",

If the mill is chocking up use an end mill with more flutes or a higher rotation speed. Also you need mills with cutting geometry specifically for soft metals like aluminium and brass on low powered machines like this. If you had tried this with brass it would have probably given even worse results because brass is so soft it tends to grab the cutter so definitely needs correct end mills with the correct geometry. Also a shorter end mill will help and repositioning the spindle higher up in the mount will produce less stresses in the z axis and gantry assemblies.",

    "comment_text": "I bought this 3020 in Nov 2021 strictly for aluminum cutting. I’ve been using a competitors machine for over a decade and it works great. I was disappointed with this machine and had several issues. It will cut aluminum but not not very well. The 1/8” bit must be all the way in the shaft. (And to prevent milling the table it’s best to lower the Z axis to the lowest point and raise the spindle in the holder so the bit can’t reach the table.) But the spindle is just not rigid enough to handle the cutting, the length of the shaft allows slight flexing. And the spindle doesn’t have enough speed or torque. I found that even slowly cutting a 1” hole in 2mm aluminum with 9 passes was nail biting. It did cut the hole but was a struggle. The finished hole was a few thousands under size because the spindle rigidity was causing it to flex inward. And just drilling a 1/8” hole w the milling bit would sputter when reaching the bottom, and wallowed the hole almost every time. So to fix both issues I hack sawed the spindle holder (another problem-only a 55mm spindle fits), and mounted a $70 rotozip (600W 30K RPM) with metal strapping. Now it mills, drills, and cuts much better. Note that after less than 10 hours the 300W spindle stopped working.\n\nThe other issue I had was that most all of the USB software I tried wouldn’t run a few commands of my existing gcode. Also, it was essential that I could stop and start the gcode from any gcode line, and couldn’t do it! So, to get around those problems I abandoned the USB controller and bought a parallel stepper driver and use LinuxCNC (or Mach2).\n\nOverall it’s a nice little machine but wouldn’t recommend for aluminum unless your into mods.",
