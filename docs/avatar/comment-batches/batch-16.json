I just got the 20w machine for $699.\n\nAmazing you can get a 50w CO2 machine for less than that new xtool 40w diode machine. Still think it‚Äôs kind of bad they pulled the 40w D1 unit just to force upsells.",

They explain that it's due to keeping it a class 1 laser (but they've been known to powder the truth in the past).\n\nThe WeCreat machine you reviewed was created to be a competitor to M1, not S1, and yes, they are both meant for the crafter segment. Sadly xTool decided to pretty much abandon M1 users with no upgrades or new features since they released air assist and riser base over a year ago.",

The only benefit versus making a basic one yourself is the auto shutoff if you have kids running around or something, but that can also be added to a homemade enclosure also without much trouble. \nSeems a bit sus that xTool pulled the 40w D1. Seems like they're trying to push people into buying this new unit. It would also be nice if they offered the ability to step down the 40w laser to 20w for finer engraving like other laser diode makers are doing, but it seems like they're more interested in getting their customers to buy an entirely different laser module... another upsell. \nWhat would be nice is to see a comparison of this unit to your favorite budget CO2 laser. It feels like this is getting expensive enough that it would be easy to jump to a goob budget friendly CO2 instead.",

    "comment_text": "I find it crazy that people buy into the unshielded lasers expecting anything good to come of it. The only laser cutter/engraver I have experience with was a massive unit with full shielding and multiple warning stickers about the dangers of laser radiation. These unshielded units are either not powerful enough to do what they advertise, or they are dangerously leaking radiation into your surroundings and you should probably discontinue using it. Generally, a laser above 5mw is enough to cause eye damage if directly shone into your eyes, and lasers above around the 250mw range can cause temporary eye damage indirectly in large exposure. Above 500mw, the damage is permanant. \n\nThese units are often claiming their lasers are \"40W\", which is 80 times the limit for permanent eye damage. This makes the lasers about 9 times more dangerous to handle for the end user. At this level, indirectly viewing the beam or the landing point of the beam will damage your eyes, likely permanantly. The wave length of the laser doesn't change much about the danger to your eye sight, as even undetectable in the UV and IR wave lengths will blind you. Non-visable-light-based lasers (say that 5 times fast) are often more dangerous as you don't even have any reflexes to mitigate the damage. Visable light lasers will cause your eye to reflexively close, which limits the exposure time and chance of blindness. IR and UV wavelengths don't trigger this response, so you won't know anything is wrong until your eye starts hurting which means the exposure time is already exceeding three times the normal amount for visable light, if not more so. Don't cheap out on laser tech, it's dangerous.",

Its for my classroom so needs to fit as a desktop unit and I was lookign at the p2 or the flux hexa\n\nMy main interest is getting a machine that can cut ~1/8 mdf faster and it is hard to get a comparison of cutting speeds (we do alot of layered designs). I was hoping the p2 or flux hexa or other desktop style co2 lasers would be significantly faster than the glowforge pro if anyone can point to evidence for that I would appreciate, thank you.",

    "comment_text": "You left out a couple of hugely important categories... 1.  \"Can you buy parts?\"  \n\nAt least one of those machines will not sell you parts, when your tube gets weak you have to ship it back to the manufacturer and they give you a coupon for a discount on a supposed \"Refurbished\" machine.   So to replace your tube cost you a few thousand dollars, or a bearing, or any other part you can't get from somewhere else.\n\n2. One thing I that wasn't clear in the \"Connectivity\" section, which machines force you to be connected to their cloud before they let you use it?  That is a HUGE deal breaker for me.  If the internet, or your router, or their server, is down so is your laser???  Not going to happen.  \n\nIf a company has that much control over whether or not you can use your machine that will eventually come around to screw you, guaranteed.  At some point that company is going to want you to pay for it's cloud, meaning a new monthly subscription service.  At any time that company could go out of business making your laser a super expensive paper weight.  Look at how many Youtube vids are out there highlighting how their projects were delayed, or completely ruined because Adobe's servers crashed so Premier locked up.  \n\nBoth of these issues make a huge difference in which lasers are usable/affordable.",

The reason is because glowforge does not run gcode, it does not and cannot accept gcode, so it's impossible for any software to interface with it.  Everything has to go through their website.  Also you have to pay a monthly fee to do anything but the very basics with their software.  If you want to cut a square, for example, through their software, that is considered a premium feature and you have to pay for that feature.\n\nBut glowforge does do passthrough nicely.\nAlso glowforge has some nice features that you've missed.  For example it detects if you cut anything that will create poison gas that will kill you.  An absolute must if you're going to put this in a classroom where a kid might be vinyl in the machine. That feature alone would make the glowforge the only option for many IMHO.",

I really like that the Xtool looks a lot easier to use than the Thunder Laser and isnt as tall but i want the best machine i can get for what i need.  Quality is super important but i need to be able to use the software too.  \n\nIm really torn as this is a huge investment.  \n\nCurrently i use ImagR to process all of my photos to engrave and import them. \n\nCan you offer your insight?
