The darkest areas are engraved the deepest and as the shades of gray get lighter, the laser engraves with less power creating a 3D effect. Is there any way to manipulate the map data to do this. I know it's kind of a tough question but I'm trying to get more into this. Thanks.",

I think it goes for $1500 (I bought the kickstarter so its obviously a diff price) and I recommend it when ease of use and safety is accounted for. Research your seller to make sure good customer service is available. I haven't had problems and I've used it for about 8 months regularly. I also never cut at 50% to help save my CO2 laser, but thats a personal pref. Never look directly at lasers, always get glasses but you still shouldn't look directly at it with glasses on either.  Also research what materials you are cutting because gases released can be harmful if youre ignorant of what you're cutting. Hope this helps and glhf :)",

Couple things is this is my VERY first project in fusion 360, so it took me a long time to get everything dialed following your steps. I appreciate the thorough-ness of everything. Few daunting parts about \"you'll have to get all this dialed yourself\" when I know nothing about the program is a little intimidating, but I just followed your lead and am about to go try and cut this thing. Also side note, I took a screen shot of fusion 360, threw it in illustrator and just did a trace draw and deleted the paths inside, and it did seem to go a little quicker (Even though I lost my scale tool bar and couldn't figure out how to bring it back up) but also was way more precise on the edges (or so it seems, will let you know after the cut). Thanks again!",

My engraving business (operational for 13 years) took three years of 18-hours a day, 7 days a week to develop and become profitable - now serving corporate customers in 22 countries around the world. To infer that simply learning to laser engrave translates into a profitable business is disingenuous. It took me a couple of days to learn to engrave - and nearly 4 years before I saw a meaningful profit.\nViewers need to know that making a kitschy trinket does not necessarily translate into a profitable business...",

Otherwise people will think a galvo can be only uses with fiber lasers which is wrong.\nIt's probably more feasible to use this combination, since fiber lasers usually have a better beam quality than diode lasers (up to 1/100, with one beeing the best and going to inf) and 1/10th the wavelength of CO2. Both increase the ability to focus the beam.",

If the galvo head is coupled to a wire source (or other pump configuration), the galvo head should be easily movable relative to the diode bank (my understanding is that fiber optic fibers/wires/cables are flexible and durable).  if the gantry could move the galvo head over a large area, that might also mitigate the other con of galvo heads you mentioned (sub optimal angles at limits of galvo head), because the galvo head wouldn’t need to be pushed to reach as far to yield a work area that seems competitive (it could stay within an optimal angular range relative to the travel of and on the gantry).  I’m not currently working in the laser industry so I apologize if this a dumb question.",

    "comment_text": "We have a glowforge midrange machine. Had it for a year running full time. It started having problems. Couldn't get any support from glowforge. It's our business so we bought another to use while the other gets fixed & can be used as a back up. My son basically started just replacing parts & the carriage turned out to be the problem. We had the new machine for 2 months. Nothing but problems with it. It wouldn't cut on normal settings. It also would start randomly not cutting or excessively burning on higher settings. Finally glowforge sent a \"referbished\" replacement for our brand new 5000$ machine. The refer machine showed up with cooling liguid leaked all over. Tried running the machine at glowforge support request & the entire laser arm is off center running crooked & is completely noisy because the track wheels are worn.\nI highly recommend no one buy a glowforge. Their customer service sucks & there is zero product support. Their poor business model is a devistating model for your business if you are trying to run 9ne with glowforge.",

I will say that since seeing them introduce the subscription service and push it so hard, I've had the constant sneaking worry that one day they'll try and lock all function of my glowforge behind a paywall, but so far they haven't done that.  I only ever upload designs so I have no need for the subscription.  If they ever do decide to brick it for a subscription (or go under and their webclient ceases to be), I'll look at other companies, but I can't afford to upgrade as long as I've got a working laser already.\n\nDespite my overall very positive experience with glowforge, I don't think I'd recommend them to someone now, when you can get a more powerful laser that can run in house software for less money.  When it was 2k, it was also one of the only really user friendly lasers on the market, and one of the cheapest lasers.  At twice the price, and still locked into glowforge's online software, I just don't see why anyone would pick it over a competitor.",

I eventually found it (great tool, thank you so much) but it took a bit of surfing around until I found it in one your review pages.  I understand why you would have it embedded in a review, logically it makes sense in that spot and it also drives more clicks around your site, but could you add a link under one of the resources? Or add a new resource for utilities that has the test file and other useful utils? That would be awesome.",

The only thing I disagree with in your video is the \"Omtech has great technical support.\"  In my actual experience, every issue is responded to (in emails - no return calls) is to clean everything and refocus the machine.  In fact, they didn't even read my email, which asked about being able to buy the on/off pushbutton switch that is sticking, and their response was to ignore me.  I asked to pay for a service call.  At this point I have actually convinced two people to buy a competitors model and I am working on my third person.  I purchased the laser and requested support from the Anaheim California location, but I have not seen anything to let me know that the entire company is not represented by the same lousy service.  I would be fine with their lack of help, but even when I asked if there was anyone who could help, I was met with silence.  I was finally able to find someone who does service for Laser in LA, and I was happy to pay for the help.  I am very disgusted with Omtech's complete lack of service.  If you are going to buy a laser, try to find someone who has and uses one.  Service / Customer Service / repair is very hard to find.",

It would not even detect the dot pattern unless I opened the lid part way.  It seemed like Lightburn doesn't like the 180 pano camera lens, but this is my first machine with a camera.   I'll fiddle more tomorrow.",
