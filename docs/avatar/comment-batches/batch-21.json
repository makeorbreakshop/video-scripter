Not ONLY is it removable, but it changes its placement, so that your auto-focus/focal distance doesn't change. \n\nFor $700, you're MUCH better off buying the Thunder, specifically due to their history and customer service. I wouldn't trust a brand new no-name company with that chunk of money or support, as things with these lasers can definitely go wrong/need replacement parts.\n\nWhy buy from a company thats trying to trim/cheapen the item, when you can literally buy from their supplier? Its like buying a knockoff.",

If you open the image to be printed in Photoshop and convert it to CMYK and save one copy with only the K channel as grayscale and the other as CMYK but leaving the black channel empty, then you print the color first and then the black one, you will have a real CMYK print. And on the other hand, there are cheaper compatible cartridges for the HP 62 cartridges.\nIt would be a good video to make.",

    "comment_text": "First of all, great review and categorization of thoose lasers! However, as a beginner, I feel like some essential information is missing, especially for desktop models. Next year, I plan to start working with small parts, around 1-4 cm thick. I mostly need engraving, and I‚Äôd like to work on multiple pieces at once (potentially different sizes but the same height), letting the laser run while I do other tasks. For this, the laser should have the capability to automatically detect the position of the workpieces and center engravings, like texts or QR codes. Otherwise, I would have to manually measure and align each piece to the 0,0 point. For example, if one piece is 50mm wide and another is 52mm wide, and I want a QR code centered, the laser should be able to automatically center it if needed. This is especially important when dealing with multiple pieces lying next to each other. I can't rely on precise X, Y coordinates because the pieces might not always be perfectly aligned, or there could be a 1-2 mm gap between them, which could throw off the centering of the engravings.",

Due to the working proximity of the laser module to the material and having to 'tilt' the ring on a rotary, I don't have enough knowledge to choose which ones are compatible with this function. The 2 I have seen have some less desirable reviews from a customer service standpoint.(I would also like it to cut thin wood and engrave various materials, of course) Thank you for any expert advice you may have!",

    "comment_text": "I've been watching your stuff for years and really appreciate your videos! I always stop here first when trying to learn about new and innovative lasers on the market. I have an ambitious project idea I was hoping to get your opinion on.  I'm thinking about building a really large work area diode setup for cutting thin fabrics. These will likely be polyester, nylon, and dyneema fabrics for cutting tent patterns. I will need it to have a 72\" usable width for the work area and probably at least 140\" length or the ability to easily and accurately index the next section of the cut (floor panels will commonly be 108\" long and need straight edge cuts). Due to the crazy size, i'm trying to find a way to make it collapsible, something i could put up and take down easily. Another idea might be to rig it to hang from the garage ceiling and drop down as needed. Hoping to go lightweight and establish rigidity with whatever i set it on for cutting (possibly concrete driveway or lightweight ply base if mounting to ceiling). Lastly, it wouldn't hurt to prioritize speed over accuracy as a cut line within an 1/8\" of the intended cut is plenty accurate (no engraving needed with this setup) Any thoughts on how achievable this would be? Not sure how the belt drive accuracy would be at that scale. Also, if you're aware of a smaller machine designed to index quickly/accurately for large prints that you think could work well in this use case, I'd love to hear about it:). Thanks again and care!",

If you have one of these, at least put an enclosure around it. BTW, a pair of laser safety goggles is a lot cheaper than eye surgery, or living the rest of your life with impaired or no vision.\n\nAir-assist. You really need it to reduce the fire hazard, as it squelches flames that try to form while cutting. Remember, a laser cutter works by burning-away material.\n\nSmoke. You dont realize how MUCH smoke gets produced till you do your first cut. Even a few small cuts on thin MDF or plywood will stink-up your entire garage. Which goes back to the first point: You need an enclosure for safety reasons as well as to gather the smoke for your exhaust fan (or air purifier).\n\nCooling. We havn't done any lengthy processing on the P2 yet. It's water-cooled and I've only seen the temp go up 1-2 degrees during usage, even when the laser is running at 100% power. A 55W CO2 laser is around 20% efficient, so you probably have 300 watts coming thru the laser tube. It's going to take awhile for that to heat-up a water tank. But if you're using an air-cooled fiber laser, it's going to heat-up faster even though it's a lot more efficient than CO2. Probably a non-issue for hobby work, because your cutter will pause a few times if it needs to cools-down.",

    "comment_text": "Great and informative video...  One option you didn't cover with regard to desktop machines is the CO2 machines sourced from China, typically available on eBay.  I went this route about 4yrs ago.  Purchased a 12\" x 20\", 50W sealed tube CO2 machine for about $1200.  It has many of the features of the more expensive domestically sourced (US made) machines.  It's not quite as refined, but it does the job just fine.   Worked for 30yrs in the industrial laser field and this machine, even though it's a lot cheaper, is every bit a \"real\" machine as the more expensive ones.  Though I don't use it for \"production work\", it could...  That said, not sure how long it'll last for with that kind of use, but for hobby users like me, it's the perfect low cost, nearly full featured machine.   The only thing mine doesn't have is a chiller and auto focus.  I use a large bin full of DI water that can be cooled by tossing in a few frozen bottles of bottled water.  Though it doesn't have auto focus, it does have a manual Z-axis table feature and I use a dial indicator to set the height based off the material thickness used.\n\nAgain...  Great and very informative video.  Continue to be amazed at the scope and quantity of equipment available to hobbyists these days!",

    "comment_text": "As a Glowforge Pro owner, there are a couple things that you did omit. I have looked at light burn and believe that I could certainly use it. But, for hobbyists and those who are not using their laser printer day in and day out, Glowforge has a remarkably easy to use interface, one that my mother could figure out.\n\nAnd let's not forget, Apple made there reputation based on software interface and ease of use .\n\nBut that said, the detractors are significant and includes several you missed. Important among them is the fact that you have to pay $240 per year just to be able to save your files to the cloud. Because they have you locked in, any file or project you create will disappear within 30 days unless you pay them their ransom. \n\nFurthermore, and this is a very little known issue, there is absolutely no way to save a project from glowforge's cloud to your desktop or any local storage device. This means that if you spend your time setting up the perfect print and go forage, you can forget about saving it unless you are paying their yearly subscription fee. I am so surprised that nobody has mentioned this as I quit paying my yearly subscription fee and lost hundreds of project files. \n\nSimilar to this videos conclusion, I would not recommend this product to anyone at any price.",
