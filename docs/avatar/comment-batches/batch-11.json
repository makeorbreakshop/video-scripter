    "comment_text": "I was also split between the LM3 and D1. After watching every review I could find and then reading purchased reviews I decided that the Ortur was the way to go for me. First, the performance seemed to be slightly better when engraving and second but more importantly were the customer service oriented ratings. There seemed to be a trend towards a lack of customer service with xTool lately. I know there is a lot of turmoil going on in China right now so this is probably a temporary thing. Lastly, Amazon had a flash sale on the LM3 the other day making it $595 so I jumped on it. That left more money for accessories which we'll need to run these at there best. Just my 2 cents... \n\nCheers,\nGreg",

    "comment_text": "Engraving DPI is hugely important.  While I know 1200 DPI on a diode or fiber is doable, they are mainly marking machines (not cutting).  When I compared machines, I asked specifically about DPI ... they all report higher numbers than to be expected AND/or skipped around an answer ... their website numbers cannot be trusted.  The newer gen. machines have better motors than the 4+ yr old designs and can consistently do +800dpi, like the 2 co2 machines you mentioned.  There are more economy options that can perform, and there are more DIY coolers that aren't messy nor expensive.  I have a BOSS 70W and can cut/engrave basically anything I desire.  but it's older and doesn't have the newer motors (so the effective DPI is about 1/2 of the newer machines with the smallest focal lens), but it can be upgraded.  If it's a hobby, speed isn't as important ... precision is.  i would never spend less than $3k on any laser, period.  People ask when i give them stuff i make: \" You did what?\"  i say:\"yes, I'm a Jedi, I cut stuff with light\".  Diodes imo don't count.  I've used over 36 types of materials .. and my co2 hasn't failed me yet.",

    "comment_text": "If you're spending 4-7 grand on a machine, the learning curve is insignificant.  Once you've learnt it, you don't keep learning it.  What does matter, is the day to day experience of using it once you've climbed that curve.  For example. I have a great bean-to-cup coffee machine.  It makes great coffee, and I can tweak it to my heart's content, even though it's a clunky interface.  What is unforgiveable, is that every single time I turn it on, I have to wait for it to go through a cleaning cycle.  I can't put my cup under the brew head until it's finished, or it will fill with dirty water, so I can't just press a button and let it do its stuff.  Before it turns off, it cleans itself again.  It cleans itself so often, I have to refill the water really often, and empty the drip tray just as often.  I have another, much less fancy, less refined machine that I bought when the other broke down.  I can press the power button, and twenty seconds later press the button to brew the coffee, and a minute later I'm drinking espresso.  It's not quite as good at making my perfect coffee, but it's pretty good, it's harder to dial it in, it's noisier, and nothing like as polished, but in daily use it's so much more user friendly that I prefer it to my other machine.\nFor laser cutters, if you have to spend a couple of minutes getting the focus just right, or you need several trial runs to set the power/speed for each job, it doesn't matter how easy to learn it is, it's going to get tiresome pretty quickly.  Another machine might be hard to learn at first, you might need to build up a database of materials and power/speeds, but if, after doing that, all you have to do is insert the stock and press start, and know that it'll do the same good job every time, that machine will win every time.",

    "comment_text": "This long comment is in no way criticising  this video. It is ,hopefully, adding more techincal colour to this already informative video.\n\n Any 50 watt tube will be 1000mmm long and 50mm diameter. 50 watts is the max power test spec. NOT what you can use. This will be an 800mm long 40 watt tube  that will fit iinsde the 970mm wide case. 50 watts is marketeing speak. There are major issues with fume extraction and Gweike have issued a couple of upgrades (check out their videos). You need air FLOW through the  machine to extract fumes. You cannot get FLOW through a closed box like the Glowforge and the little grill on the Gweike is an inadequate  concession to this requirement of physics. \n600mm/s is a meaningless marketing spec if you dont have the power to damnage material at that speed . Every different type of wood or material has a different damage threshold so the MDF used in this test  requires a critical level light  INTENSITY for a certain EXPOSURE time to damage it. The fixed INTENSITY of a candle flame will damage your hand if you pass it through the flame slow enough.......that demonstates what exposure time means... That is the whole  principle of engraving. The Gweike  has a typical 2\" lens but you can make the candle beam more intense  because Gweike supply a shorter 1.5\" lens. and that means faster engraving .....but poorer cutting. Not an option on the Glowforge. \n\n The overtavel at the end of each scan depende on the speed you choose to scan at. If you decide to run at 300mm/s (as per the video)  then the overtravel  is a fixed non-engraving event.  In this case the Gweike  is running at 250dpi so there are also 250 scans  per inch of image that is 500 non-engraving events per inch. The Glowforge has 450 non engraving events per inch. So there is MORE wasted time on the Gweike but it still engraves quicker becuse of its shorter overtravel (faster acceleration.)  Because the Gweike machine can run with the native Ruida software (RDWorks) or Lightburn. you have the opportunity to crank up the acceleration (software controlled) and make the Gweike run light years faster than the  \"you cant touch anything\" Glowforge.\n\nSpeed is meaningless for cutting, it always has to be done slowly, maybe 10 to 20mm/s would be typical  depending on material and thickness.. Neither machine is setup with  a cutting  configuration where the nozzle would  be close to the work. Thus any air assist is only protecting the lens and not making cutting more efficient. These are essentially engraving machines that can cut inefficiently.  Look at all the brown fume depositions around the cuts., that means  air  assist will do a great job of painting your engravings with this tarry residue.   \n\nCutting should always be done with a single pass, which CO2 lasers can do easily because they operae on a totally different wavelength to diode laserswhich for many physics reasons are very inefficient at cutting and require multiple passes.\n\n Auto focus is a big problem. A lens will be sold with a fixed focal length. But that focal length does NOT apply to lasers.That lens will work as specified if you put it into a telescope or camera where you are focusing an IMAGE with normal random non-coherent light. A laser beam si totally different and there is no IMAGING involved .  the aim is to focus light INTENSITY. If you focus a lens to cut efficiently at 10mm/s  it is certain that the best focal distance will be at least 1mm different to the manufacturer's fixed focus. Now try engraving at 400mm/s and the best focus (thinnest line) will be 2 or 3mm different.. The best focus also depends on the material being used. So power, speed and material can all affect the optimal INTENSITY focal point. So how can auto focus take all these factors into account? Thus the less sophisticated motor driven (software controlled) focus of the Gweike allows you to take thes various parameters into account  and lets YOU select the best focus  when you understand a bit more about the peculiarities of laser technology.\n\n$50/month to ACCESS a machine that you may have already paid $5000 for  seems  scam that no one would ever fall for.   Hmmmm.  Ease of use?. I can remember when I was 5,  I probably had little or no technical ability. This machine would have been a great techno toy where I could make things happen with little or no knowledge of the technology. As a 5 year old it would have still required my dad to set it up before I could \"play\" with it.. This is a well presented video  but he and I  cant unlearn knowledge,  so making a  \"an ease of use\" judgment is very difficult. Where is the baseline?\n\nAs a business machine for making money the Gwieke wins hands down. Its faster (and, with knowledge, can be made even faster),  greater flexibility, much lower price. no forced rental of software and  no need for an internet connection. It also allows you to make mistakes and learn about laser technology in the process, so that  you are prepared for your jump up to a bigger more powerful machine.  Glowforge is a closed box where you have purposely been excluded from learning about laser technology. Its a great business model .\n\n\nFinal technical note. 100%power ?  The tube %power is not really watts. This is glass tube technology and the tube manufacturer specifies the safe  MAXIMUM current allowed to flow through the tube. The tube watts is determined by the current flow. For a 40 watt tube  the max RUNNING current you can use will be 18mA for a 40 watt tube and  19mA for a 45 watt tube (Do I believe Glowforge is 45 watts?  Note the tube dimensions and check on any tube manufacturers website). It is possible to set the high voltage power supply so that 100%power  does not exceed  these limits. This  protects the tube and give it 4 years or more life. I belive the Gweike has an ammeter fitted that allows you to check this.  Glowforge?  I think not.   Exceeding these limits through lack of knowledge  could be expensive and ruin your tube within a year. The mA current flow and watts output are not related linearly   so for example  for your 18mA  max current you will get 40 watts output  but at 1/3 of the current flow (6ma) you will be expecting 33%power ie13 watts.  Sadly no,  because the relationship is non-linear you will probably be delivering 20 or evern 25 watts. The % power applies to current flow through your tube and NOT watts.   50% power is not 20 watts.",

Terrible, greedy company with an unreliable product.  $50 a month for the most basic software functionality is pure robbery and was an absolute insult to everyone who forked over cash only to wait years through the initial ‚Äùdelays‚Äù.   No reason why it couldn‚Äôt be controlled locally with the same features.  Autofocus has never worked for me.  The camera is at best 1/2‚Äù off making it basically useless.  It can‚Äôt even manage to scan its own QR codes.",

My concern is more based on a recent comment (mom23sweetpeas). These manufacturers really need to get their act together with customer service. It's a deal-breaker at this price level IMO. We're not all mechanically or technically minded. I don't think I'd have had the resilience to have endured all of that, and at the end they had to send back at great inconvenience.\n\nStill it's a shame; the g-machine looks fabulous and would have otherwise been my choice between the two.",

Basically they are just trying to copy the Glowforge with no real innovation, but at a reduced cost.\nReally hoping for the next iteration of tech before I have to choose. \nAlso, the subscription software has a lot of add-ins now like patterns, shapes, and borders. it also stores all your prints, so you can reprint something really quick.",

As an owner of a glowforger for over 2 years I have learned a lot and definitely have things I like and don't like that I hope are changed/kept with future glowforge models and wouldn't mind also seeing how other machines do these things better or worse.

    "comment_text": "A 20W diode laser ALREADY exceeds the capability of 40-50W CO2 machines on cutting. That is because of the smaller dot size. Typical CO2 machines will have a dot size of .1mm to .15mm diameter compared to the dot size of .08mm x .1mm on the diode machines. A smaller dot size means the power is concentrated more. You will NOT be cutting 10mm plywood in a single pass on a 50W CO2 machine (I have one). Also, engravings will not be as crisp, although the larger CO2 machines offer faster engraving output from better rails and more powerful stepper motors.",

I use LightBurn on the Xm-1060.   I make artistic wood boxes, so this worked well for that.   K40 did etch glass, stone, cut leather and wood, and engraved fairly decently...  The only upgrades I did was a better exhaust, diamond grill bed and a new Lens ..  My son owns a Glowforge.  He doesn't use it 3% of what I use my Xm-1060 or even the K40!  I think the K40 with the dsp, exhaust, mirror, lense and new controller ( with Lightburn ) is all you need for more than casual use of the K40.",

    "comment_text": "Glowforge was my introduction into the laser world (purchased through their original Kickstarter campaign in 2016), and 7 laser purchases later, I still use three Glowforge's daily.  Luckily 90% of our products are flat acrylic, smaller pieces that the Glowforge can handle easily so as far as ease of use goes, we just keep at least two of them cranking out products daily.  We do love Lightburn when it comes to the larger 150W CO2 we use for our big stuff, rotary, etc. as well as our new Fiber laser (thank god for Lightburn Galvo) so we can see how both situations bring value to your business.  Being an early Glowforge adopter, we paid half the price for both of our Basics and our Pro, so I'm not sure if I would choose Glowforge now at their current price point, but I really do love the cameras, auto-focus, and small footprint.  And their customer service has been other-worldly as well (several replacements (not necessarily their fault), overnight parts delivery, you name it).",

    "comment_text": "By not including much about the pass through you are missing most of what makes the Glowforge pro better. Otherwise your G-machine is far more comparable to the Glowforge machines in the same price bracket. Instead of he 14 inch height of the G-machine the Pro can use material as big as you can fit in the house, not only for large projects but I buy my material 48\" long and use as much as I need  Yes the 40 watt machines are rated at less power, but Glowforge does not \"overclock\"their machines so they last longer than if they run at max power. As for premium, if someone is trying to make money right away premium  opens up thousands of free designs that they can legally sell right away so if you have a market. If you want to design in Inkscape you have less of an incentive, but I still find many conveniences that I  use instead of going back to Inkscape or Gimp and reloading. With the many free designs ( full disclosure a few of mine as well) there is also access to the entire Noun Project that does not allow commercial use of their designs, but Glowforge worked out a deal and they get some of that premium fee also. So if you do not want to learn Inkscape, Gimp or many of the more pricey options. The Glowforge app is av pretty good design tool that you can even use on your tablet or phone. \n\nOn another point, once the cur is loaded on to the machine there is no internet needed, so if the internet goes out while it is cutting it will not affect the machine. Unfortunately you cannot keep running that file again, though many have suggested it. Which brings up another point. There is a great deal of hands on connection that takes place over time. There are many complaints that connecting to support is more time consuming  than they like, but the volume is huge and it may take a bit, but the final result is far better than my abilities to interact with any other company.",

I did a ton of research and ended up buying a Thunder Laser USA.... Nova 35-100watt. It came in at almost the same price and the difference in these two machines are immeasurable. The Thunder Laser came with over double the power. The ability to cut/engrave 24\"x36\" and had pass through. Not to mention it has over 7\" of z height with the ability to use a rotary. I honestly can't believe people pay so much for a GlowForge. Do your research and you can either save a lot of money or get a industrial quality laser for the same price. \nhttps://youtu.be/bqObk0NKbTc",

Did not get the GF due to 1. closed system in both software and hardware and 2. price. If anyone is looking for other users of the GC, their facebook group(s) is your best place. They have like 3 facebook groups and it is confusing but join them all. You will find me and many others on there who love the GC.\n\ncomments to the video:\n-gweikeclouds hinges are horrible unless you open it all the way (not sure how the GF is). better if the hinges hold at any angle. \n-passthrough is easy. just stick a magnet or something metal where the sensor is. but unfortunately fumes will escape.\n-air compressor indeed is external on the GC but that means you can swap it to whatever you want. on GF its not upgradeable.\n\nAnd yes, a big con is gweikes marketing. case and point you mention \"autofocus.\" something is lost in translation there. They also make this mistake marketing the air assist. Heck a big con is indeed this overseas translation thing. While tech support is VERY responsive (you get assigned to like 7 tech people through an app after the purchase of the machine) sometimes small details can be lost in translation. Is that worth paying the thousands for a GF over the GC? nah. its not THAT bad but just a heads up from me to whoever looking to buy a GC.\n\nAlso i should mention for cost of the GC, it CAN get even cheaper as Gweike runs events here and there where you can get cash that brings down your initial purchase cost.",

    "comment_text": "This was a very helpful video!  I would love to ask you what is the machine that you would get, similar travels on the axes with more on the z if possible, that can mill aluminum without serious compromise.  \n\nSince aluminum likes to mess with us with it being gummy let's machine the gummiest aluminum - is that 6061 - if not please just specify and let's make say a motor mount plate.  So a square shape, say 3\"x3\" by 3/8 or 1/2\" when finished with a bunch of holes punched through for through bolts, some holes to be tapped, \n\nLets also mill a pattern into the face of this square of aluminum that is say a 2\" square shape that is 1/4\" wide square track that we are ending with. The feature is also a finished depth of 1/4\".  \n\nSo if we are using proper feeds and speeds from the machinists handbook or other proper sources what is the most depth we can take on each pass say even on your typical industrial heavy duty vertical milling machine.  That sets our target or best possible case, then can you answer in your opinion which brand machine in these low dollar tiers do you think can actually come close to this level of performance.\n\nLast but not least this machine needs to be capable of true 3d milling into aluminum. Lets say we are going to mill a ball shape where we have a semi-circle full round shape the diameter of the circle is 3\" and the height at the center of the shape is also 3\" - so we are getting what would look like a bandsaw slice through part of a pool ball cut in half,   Which machine can get great surface finishes and also do the work in a reasonable amount of time.  I am assuming that if a machine could make this 3d feature then it could likely make most features that i would ever need it to.  Please let me know if this is a poor assumption.\n\n\nThis whole CNC market has so many machines that could never hope to do this work which is fairly basic work for sure.  And I know that this was a little bit to read but I am hoping those of you with knowledge and experience will simply be able to just snap your fingers and say - yea, get a \"THIS BRAND\" and get \"MODEL ABC123\", they are great!  \n\nOh damn, we can't forget about cost, I would ask 2 things for cost.  1 - can you do this for under $1000?  How about for under $800 and wow if we can you can do this for $500.  \n\nI have no idea what to expect so I hope that there is some feedback and all of it is going to be greatly appreciated.  Cheers!",

    "comment_text": "Glowforge might be the winner for ease of use. But as soon as your Cloud-Connection is gone for whatever reason, your business is basically screwed for that time. As much as i'm into the build quality and design of Glowforge machines, this web-only approach just won't be happening for me. Especially on a 5000+$ machine. \nAnd to be fair, once you get into Lightburn (which i'd say takes less than a week), it is just SO powerful! I would have never expected this amount of useful stuff, hidden behind that kinda 90s looking UI! <3",
