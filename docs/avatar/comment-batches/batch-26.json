Even though Bambu sells acrylic on their site, i have yet to find anyone who has actually cut it,   I was really hoping to it would cut acrylic and etch it as well,  one of the bigger reasons i even got the laser,  but now after reading about how did its going to get, i dont think its worth the upgrade, only the future will tell, it would be great if you used this a lot and then made an update after so many hours..   thanks",

    "comment_text": "Absolutely save the money and buy a dedicated laser printer.  The difference that you didn't mention when you compared the additional cost  of the 40W Bambu when compared to just buying the S1 is the cut size.  The camera is a nice feature, but with the alignment functions of the S1 it is minimal.  Having roughly twice the cut capacity, plus having a dedicated machine is going to completely offset the few hundred dollar difference.  Plus, XCS is a great software solution on it's own for beginners, but you can use LightBurn on the S1 when you grow beyond the limited feature set you get with Bambu Studio.\n\nAdditionally, I guarantee that the more you use the laser, the more dirty the inside of the 3D printer is going to get.  Take a picture of the inside of a P2 or P2S that gets daily use and you'll see what I mean.\n\nFinally, the problem with having a shared machine is that when the H2D eventually has a failure, you lose all of your ability to work whereas if you have different machines, you can at least still do something.",

That may sound a bit odd, but the laser module is already shipped separately from the printer itself, and the Laser edition actually has other features that the non-Laser variants do not such as cutting and drawing.  Once the laser module is sold separately (I didn't find it on their store at the time of writing), then you could buy one when/if you wanted one.  They have talked about releasing an upgrade kit for the basic H2D, but given that the upgrade kit just puts you at the same level as a H2D Laser without the laser, I'd rather just buy that from the start.",

Kickstarter has no promises you will receive your product, and no refunds if you don't. The E1 is at nearly $40 million, and if the owners are secretly sh*theads like some crowdfunding campaigns have had, they can just pocket that money, close up shop, and retire. You can't even sue over it because you have to acknowledge the pledge is merely a donation.\n\nKickstarter never has been and never will be a pre-order platform. These companies need to run their pre-orders on their own sites to be credible, as kickstarter won't stop them. This project alone has made Kickstarter over $1 million in platform fees.",

    "comment_text": "Update to delivery issues on this machine.  After contesting the charge on my credit card, whether that had anything to do with it or not (?), I did finally receive all ordered items.  The rotary was broken and AtomStack replaced that within a week.  With the exception of the 3rd mirror adjustment at the laser head - difficult to adjust due to the air assist tubing and the auto focusing wires disconnecting regularly (faulty connecter), oh and the decision not to provide free shipping so I'm still out $400, the machine is actually pretty good so far.  Pro: very robust metal build, this thing is solid! Proprietary software is good, I use both that and Lightburn, depending on what I am doing, and it is pretty precise.  Cons: difficult lens adjustment (laser head design could have been a bit better at little extra effort), rotary accessories are workable but made of plastic and don't have the same sturdiness of the laser (honestly, it's a beast!), but they work, just be gentle with them.  Support is decent.  I ordered during the Dragon Festival so that holiday gummed up the customer service a bit.  Expect delays in response due to  being on the other side of the world and the language barrier... some of the replies were difficult to decipher due to the language barrier.  Overall - I'm growing to really like this machine.",

The smell of exhaust fumes is unbearable. The burnt dust that is created during cutting or engraving is sticky and smelly. If you do not have a closed box laser with an activated carbon filter or at least an exhaust system outside the workshop, do not think about the laser business. These toys for a few hundred dollars are only suitable for amateur fun - no protection against the laser beam (risk of eye damage), toxic fumes, low power, low speed. Such a laser is only suitable for home-made - once in a while - for fun, for a hobby - provided that exceptional safety rules are observed.",

They do have some parts but it's very normal for them to go out of stock for months with 0 way to backorder. Anker also abandoned their slicer software and mobile app years ago. It was left in a pretty buggy state. They have also outsourced a lot of their support to members of their discord community and have almost no official interaction with customers there. Community members have had to build custom print profiles for orca because the default profiles were extremely poor and resulted in repeated print failures. There also have been multiple reports of customers returning defective printers under warranty and being sent back a barely functional refurbished unit with major problems. I am confident this product works well and based on what I see there's nothing else on the market similarly priced. Just keep in mind anker support is awful and they do not have any loyalty to you as a customer. They will abandon you the second this product appears to be a commercial failure.",

About the function with taking out the bottom that would be a great option then to set-up the machine so that you don't need to take out the blade frame for engraving/cutting with the right setup. Just place the bottom piece first to get the right spot for engraving, lift up the machine on anything steady hard wood or so on and done. figure out the right height for being able to do the cutting properly and you're set. depending on the laser only if it is still strong enough to cut out properly. Since it is a diode laser might be tricky. otherwise your review was much more helpful than their own introduction video because you keep it simple and technical great info what are most important and not just selling blind impulse buyers.",

(standalone device.) the laserdriverboard from BJJCZ, supports a rotary port trugh microstepdriver DM452. i think i need to connect autofocus motor at rotaryport after using it as autofocus system. only changing cable layout when switching. have u other sugestion? need automatic z-axes and autofocus.

In terms of construction and quality of the machines, any customer service, general experience?\nI work with wood, acrylic and other materials suitable for a diode laser. For several years I have been using both co2 and diode engravers (not mine), and I decided to get a machine for myself. The most important thing is to have a large work area, for this reason my choice went to the s70 max (the alternative would be Atomstack A70 max, same characteristics but I read several negative opinions on after-sales assistance) thank you",

    "comment_text": "Being in school photography since 2016, I have lots of experience with printers. And the of the biggest issues are with the print head and ink.\n\n- Ink tends to dry out and clog. Any news on how thos is handled with the resin? I known it's UV resin and doesn't exactly dry out. But over time, it can still happen. Colored resin isn't just resin. There's still ink particles that can clump up when sitting idle.\n\n- The print head is easily the most annoying component. They shift and rare out over time. They're not easy nor cheap to replace. And it's not like we can just call a repair shop to come over and fix this one.\n\n- I've ran into far too many issues with the ink spilling all over the printhead and down onto the paper and internal components. How would that be addressed with this printer? Resin would be a lot more difficult to remove than traditional liquid or powder ink.\n\n- To add to that, how easy is it to repair/place the print bed components? The belt, the gears, etc?",

I'm wondering if the higher wattage are adjustable to your needs. I know power and speed go together, but you also want a precise and fine laser point when engraving smaller items. Just a point of view.",
