Just recently, the machine that has the rotary attachment started engraving the tumblers very badly. Like I tried everything to fix it, I put max resolution, lowered the speed all the way to 10, tried double engraving (it didn't work, the tumbler slips the second pass), I tried using the magic eraser to clean the leftover residue, and none of them worked. Does anyone know what to do in that situation? I am a seller on Amazon and Etsy and this problem is killing me.",

You have to understand what Lasers can do and do not do. I hope I can purchase something again soon now that even a 100-watt cutter and engraver are less than 25K!   Our Laser Shop also did acrylic we had a local shop that had at the time a 600-watt flatbed Mitsubishi and it would cut 1/2 inch acrylic like butter! Miss those days!",

I have paid over $40,000 (Australian)  for Solidworks over the years and that is cheap compared to ProEngineer (Creo) and UniGraphics that preceeded it, but Fusion is way superior, especially if you need to use CNC etc, the Delcam / FeatureCam / HSMWorks tech rolled into Fusion is outrageously good for the price. So take your free subscription and go to FreeCAD, or other halfway house for amatuers, and there will be far less wingeing..",

Because of the COVID virus we have now lost the only place I would have gone to look at and ask questions about it.  That is FRY's Electronics.  I was going to build a newer computer with newer components.  I like to buy locally and now there is no second choice place to go.  The whole printing and engraving environment is changing so fast I have been deliberately slow to get involved and jump in.  Would you be able to make suggestions on where to focus if I mentioned some of the criteria involved?  1)  Engrave small objects like in the size of Keys, Knife handles and up to the size of 6 inches square for just a little more versatility;  2)  Because of size - price should be small due to the versatility and usefulness is reduced (comparatively);  3)  Precision - due to the size of the engravings they will be examined closely.  4)  Engrave or etch but NOT cut through.  5) Small because of my needs and can't have it take up a lot of room.   6)  Engrave any metals that will dis-color noticeably. \n\nAll these are valid reasons that must be evaluated together.     If you can please give me a few suggestions.  Because I don't know what the prices may be, please consider price to be of the lesser requirement.  I want a good one that will do the job.

    "comment_text": "was a great video to stumble upon after trying to find some honest answers on engraving as a total beginner! I diddd have a specific question, you mentioned briefly \"logo on cutting board\" which is my intent for one, however the unit i was looking at was kind of a box that had everything inside of it. the diode was 3w, but no one ever says \"it can engrave all of these, dont get it if you use it on these\". I want it to be able to do walnut, but everything always just says wood, and there are so many species of wood of different hardness, i cannot for the life of me find a simple yes. In your opinion, 3w diode able to surface engrave (maybe 1/8\") walnut, and other hardwoods.",
