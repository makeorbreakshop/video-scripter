    "text": "I never post any reviews. I just want people to be aware of how hard it is to get a hold of someone in the company. I have an issue with my laser firing. They told me that usually its the hinge on the machine that collects debris causing the laser not to fire. This worked for maybe 2-3 cuts. I am back to the same problem. Now, the machine no longer fires. The machine homes and \"enables laser\" but not light when framing the project. When I disable fan and hit start, the machine acts like it is firing. I am following the instructions word for word. I have checked the settings. I have reinstalled the software. Looked the FAQ. I have emailed, called and left messages, and did the online chat.  The team seems really nice. I would just like someone to get in touch with me to trouble shoot. I am willing to send my machine back and have them fix it.   I can't recommend this product because the customer service is subpar. I just wanted to make a gift for my two year old. I am happy to update this if I ever get a hold of them.",

    "text": "I‚Äôve had my eye on the Aeon Mira 5S Redline, and I have a few questions regarding my product line that I plan to work with. I want to make sure the machine fits my specific needs, so I‚Äôm hoping you can provide some insights.\r\n\r\n1. Can the engraving and cutting height be automatically adjusted to uneven surfaces (e.g., wavy materials)? Ideally, I‚Äôd like a 3D mapping system where I can freely define the measurement points based on the material. I‚Äôd like to set the number of measurement points per square cm or at least define a measurement area to ensure the engraving or 3D map is as accurate as possible.\r\n\r\n2. Is there an automated height detection system or any add-ons for soft materials like leaves or flowers, which are difficult to measure with mechanical height detection?\r\n\r\n3. What is the noise level of the machine and the exhaust system? I plan to use it in my home, so that‚Äôs important for me.\r\n\r\n4. When working with larger materials that are fed through the machine, is it possible for the engraving or cutting to be automatically detected and seamlessly extended? I‚Äôm looking for intelligent software that can adjust the engraving path automatically without needing to manually realign the material.\r\n\r\n5. Do you use or recommend any infeed track with a stopper and optional conveyor belt for precise material alignment and consistent movement at the right angle during the process?\r\n\r\n6. Is there an intelligent function for engraving multiple identical materials? I would like the machine to detect and optimize the engraving process across multiple pieces with identical designs, to save time and ensure consistent results.\n\nI know that the xTool P2S has most of the features I need, and their software is actually quite good. However, it seems that they may have purchased reviews on Trustpilot, and their customer support has been quite disappointing, so I don‚Äôt fully trust this company.\n\nI‚Äôm also interested in experimenting with inlays in small QR codes, around 30x30mm, where the glass tube CO2 laser might reach its limits. It could be better to go for an RF option, but I‚Äôm not sure if Aeon is the right choice for this. You may have a better idea of what would suit my needs best, considering you‚Äôve tested a larger product range and are up to date with the latest technologies.\n\nI‚Äôm based in Germany, so it would be good if there aren‚Äôt any issues with shipping or customer support, but that‚Äôs mostly optional.\n\nBest regards",

This is comparable to lower end CO2 machines. So why not just get the CO2? Well, for one, the cut quality seems to be cleaner with a diode laser, as they usually have smaller kerf and are consistent across the entire work area. The versatility of light cutting up to 15mm and more detailed engraving in a single machine is probably a better option for hobbyists than a small CO2 laser.

Creality is an FDM printer company just trying to stay relevant so their support on their lasers are non-existent. Maybe I got a dud, but my friend bought one as well and had a similar experience.

I've only had the machine for a week, so my issues will probably resolve with some practice. The most difficult part for me has been to accurately align the honeycomb to the frame and  spoilboard(s), and then aligning the objects to be engraved/cut.  But this is somewhat due to using an Xtool D1 Pro, I think.",

How loud is it in decibels? How loud when you add in the air assist? Also what type of maintenance is needed for the laser one (weekly, monthly? your recommendations). Also a quick run down for new people like me on what materials you can use with it would have been nice (but I can check the website for that). \n\nI'm looking at getting a laser this Jan or Feb.

The inside of the machine? Constantly filthy. You have to clean the lens every couple of hours to keep it from getting scorched, and the build quality is‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs just say, not great. I‚Äôve spent so much time on fixing shit, dat I could‚Äôve paid for a whole new machine by now. And customer service? Practically nonexistent. They pass you around, and might call back two weeks later, right after you‚Äôve DIY-fixed the issues.\n\nThe P2S was my top pick‚Äînot just for the minor upgrades, but mostly for the bed size (23.6‚Äù x 12‚Äù) and speed. And let‚Äôs be real‚Äîtheir ads are literally everywhere. You can‚Äôt escape them! This company must have piles of cash to burn; it‚Äôs insane how much they‚Äôre pouring into marketing. There are other niche brands like Bolt and Mira, but their bed sizes are too small for my needs, and the pricing is all over the place. Then I saw the ONELASER X, launching right after the P2S, and this new brand checked all my boxes: a bigger bed size (26‚Äù x 14‚Äù), excellent build quality, twice the speed, a clean cabinet design with an enclosed base, and full US-based support., Honestly, I was nervous about going with a new brand, but now I‚Äôm convinced I made the right choice.\n\nHopefully, OneLaser ships my order on time‚Äîbecause that‚Äôs the important part they can‚Äôt afford to mess up!

Thanks for the excellent insights‚ÄîI‚Äôm looking forward to working with this machine!\n\nOne of the most innovative features, and something I find especially valuable, is the built-in air quality indicator. This sensor is a game changer, allowing real-time air quality monitoring, which is particularly helpful in a closed room with only a window for ventilation. I had been considering purchasing a separate air quality sensor, so having this integrated feature is a fantastic benefit.

GF also has a status light, though I'm not sure if it's as function rich.\nQuestions:\nA) Why is it that the mirrors on GF never need calibration? I don't know if it's even possible. \nB) How does GF stay cool with never having to change any liquids? \n\nThanks for your videos. Very good!",

I have been seriously looking at the Thunder Bolt, but now the OneLaser XRF comes on the market. So, I am watching all the \"first impressions\" videos and reviews. Thanks, Charlie in Central Ohio, but soon to be Central Florida !!",
