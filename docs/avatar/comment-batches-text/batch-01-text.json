    "text": "If you focus on the ground instead of the horizon, you will see an obvious distortion in several places on the lens, particularly at 2x speed. The fluctuation in the horizon is slight, but also apparent. The horizon does appear to have a curve later in the video, but the math is wrong on the curve based on the distance and current globe calculations, so we can assume that any fluctuating horizon is due to how the lens focuses the picture. The horizon is more steadily horizontal on the flight up, though again with slight fluctuating along the line. Another detail is that the horizon always stays at eye/lens level and never falls/curves away, indicating an ongoing plane (flat area) of Earth and not a rounded shape of Earth. Interesting to note is that there are no stars and there is no moon at this height.  To burn any assumptions, I'm neither a flat earther nor a round earther (nor any other shape earther). These items were interesting, so I thought to mention to them.",

    "text": "I actually have a CO2 laser that cuts metal. I imported a full size 4x8 table from China. It has two heads. I only paid $8500\n\nThe key to being able to cut metal is POWER. You need your laser tube to be rated at 180w (peak) with 150w nominal. So don't only get a 150w tube and think you've got enough power. (Maybe for super thin sheet metal) The way you can find out if the laser you are looking at can even begin to cut metal, is the head. They are significantly more chunky, look industrial. But they are known in the biz as \"Metal/Non-Metal\" heads. That's the phrase you are looking for. My table came with a water chiller, up/down front half table, 2 blower motor fume extractors, extra honeycomb top, rotary attachment and small aquarium pump. But I'm using a silent air compressor, it barely needs any real PSI above 40 anyway. And believe it or not, all of it runs on a 120v. (Even though I just converted the actual table to 220v, so I'm not tripping breakers running the water chiller, blower fans and an air compressor all at once. I had to do the extension cord thing across the shop for awhile to catch different outlets not on the same circuit)\n\nMore about the head I use to cut steel with... It can cut up to 4mm mild steel and 3mm stainless. Which is crazy to think about, considering the price point. The other thing you will absolutely need is a bottle of oxygen from a welding supply store. You only need to use that when cutting steel. So it's a minor cost factor even if you are just messing around. The other benefit of that particular head is that it can also cut 1\" thick acrylic, with glassy smooth polished edges. The secondary head I mentioned, I only use really for cutting thin stuff, most mostly engraving. I believe that one is rated at 80w peak.",

    "text": "Okay, I find your video both informative and misleading. you mention the TOP laser engravers, However, you do not mention that they are all \"Hobby Lasers\" and not professional engravers. Nor are any of them ever mentioned in the major trade publications like Engravers Journal.  There you will see article and advertisements for the true top laser engravers. that said I have a big problem with Full Spectrum Laser.  Having done business with both Trotec and Epilog  and having been involved with a number of different types of laser, I find FSL to be the worst company in the business that I know of.  I had a Muse engraver back in 2016. Having had better machines and knowing that the Muse was only a Hobby Laser, I still found it to be a big problem. Files would not load, the Claim that corel draw files were fully compatible a joke. Having a BS in Computer Information Systems (programming major) It was clear the first day that the software had serious flaws. The design part of the software would not even display properly. Some of the tools were partly hidden and there was no way to make them display or usable. The few things that I was able to draw would not save and be available in the main window. The machine itself was flimsy and the cheaply built. Mirrors were not aligned and not easy to align. The claim FSL advertised back in 2016 that the Muse does not need to be connected with the internet to work was a marketing ploy to try to get sales that might have gone to Glowforge. Bottom line here is the claim that the Muse did nt need to be connected to the internet is both true and misleading.  The true part is that the muse can be operated while not connected to the internet. What thye don;t say much about is the fact that you do have to have an internet connection and have the Muse connected to the internet and turned on. FSL sends updates to the Muse all the time. If your machine is not connected it does not receive the updates. History since 2016 has shown that many muse owners that had machines that worked one day found that their Muse would not work at all the next day (After FSL had sent an update).  FSL lies about capabilities of their machines. They advertised that a materials database would be into the Muse. It said that on their web site and I verified it with my salesman before buying. No Muse has ever had the materials database. After I made a fuss on several Facebook forums Full spectrum Laser removed any mention that the Muse was to come with the database.  My first Muse bluescreened the second morning I had it. I let FSL talk me into a replacement machine. Thy lied about that too. First they said that if I would let them send me a replacement machine they would ship it out that same day. And they claimed it would be fully tested and working as advertised. However, that is not what happened at all. FSL waited until my first machine got back to them. Second, the second machine had the exact same problems as the first one. There 30 day 100% refund policy is something they run from. If you call tech support they will try to help you. that is as long as you go along whit what they offer. As soon as you tell them that you want to return your machine for a refund, they stop responding to you completely. Lucky for me I was persistent. I called multiple times a day and send emails several times a day. No response for 8 days. When I did get someone to talk to me he informed me that they would not pay the return shipping. Had I bought a machine and then just decided that I did not want it, that would have been reasonable. However, when you get a machine that clearly has major problems and will not work as advertised they should pay for the return shipping. So I sent the Muse back at a cost to me of $271.73. Then when FSL received the Muse they took more than 30 days before refunding part of my money. Yes, that is correct. They have a restocking fee they take out of your purchase price. Again if i was returning a work machine simply because I did not want it, a restocking fee would be reasonable.  Before I shipped the Muse back I told the at Full Spectrum Laser that I did not think it was right to make the owner of a non working machine be responsible for return shipping and then to add insult to injury charge a restocking fee.  My comments to them were that if they gave me all my money back, I would go away. However, if they did not refund all my money I would make it a point to tell as many people as possible how they do business.  Long story short I lost well over $500 to FLS. The return shipping was $271.73. Then the restocking fee took another $250 of my refund.    The only concession here is I have for my trouble is I did make a fuss on a number of forums. After more than 2 years, I contacted the head guy. we had a phone conversation. At the end of that call FSL did refund my $250 Restocking fee. However, they refused to refund the $271.73 I paid to ship their Muse back to them.  Not to long after returning the Muse I started a fb group called Muse Buyers. There I now have well over 400 members. Some have Muse engravers. Several tried to return their machine for refund. FSL stalled and would not respond to them. once the 30 day refund period ends they will respond but will not take back your machine. To be fair, of the members of my group that own a Muse, a few  have only goo things to say about it. However there are more members that have a Muse that does not work.",

Seems like there's a bunch of improvements over the typical chinese laser, things that you won't see on a spec sheet and might not even appreciate until actually using it (or in my case, using an inferior laser with much to be desired).\n\nI have a now discontinued bodor machine and it's just to subpar. There's a few videos on it but surprisingly, there aren't a lot of in depth reviews on laser cutters of any brand. For example, i can't find any videos going super in depth on trotec machines aside from the content that trotec puts out. Which to be fair, is very good quality.\n\nAnyway some aspects that you don't hear much about:\n\n- bed/table system (positioning, locking or other features)\n- quality of honeycombs (size, shape, material, framing)\n- depth under table and debris collection system if any\n- airflow design\n- air assist system and features\n\nI think the reason is there's a very small crossover between buyers of the more expensive CO2 lasers and content creators.

    "text": "I'm interested to see how you come along with this machine.  I really like mine but I'm inexperienced with laser engraving.  I've had 3d printers for years, so I like small CNC machines like this...   So far, I've mostly been playing around and working ON the machine doing upgrades, not so much WITH the machine, but that's not a complaint and not due to any fault of the machine. It worked 'fine' out of the box. \n\nI wanted to mention the grounding to you though.  They paint the shell before they put the grounding hardware in.  You will likely find that you don't have a good earth ground to shell and it could be very dangerous.  Following advice of others, I removed the washer and ground it bare under the washer.  I also did the same under the PS, but prob was overkill.  I plan to replace the power inlet and 120 plugs on the back because they are garbage.  I also don't like the fact that full line voltage goes all the way to the power switch on the control panel then back down to the PS.  I want to replace the inlet with a better quality unit with dual pole switch built in so there is no voltage inside the control chamber at all when i have my hands in there. I wanted to make sure you and anyone else with one of these knew about the poor grounding since it's a pretty serious safety issue.   Before I fixed it, i did get a pretty decent shock by touching the edge of the sheet metal where the paint was thin.  Some people recommend to run a direct connection to earth ground with its own ground spike. (Do your own research though, I'm not an electrician just trying not to shock myself or burn the house down LOL)\n\nYou do need to get an ammeter in there asap so you can tell what's actually going on with laser power.  You simply connect it between Cathode of the laser tube and the PS.  If the needle moves backward, reverse it\n\nOver all I'm happy with the OM Tech though.  I ordered a different \"K40\" at first.  When it arrived it had been dropped and dented badly so I returned it.  Long story short, the seller was a jerk so I eventually got it refunded by UPS and ordered this machine instead.  I'm glad I did.  This one is much sturdier and just generally better.  I've mostly been learning about the control system so far and upgrading the electronics.  I figure I should understand how it works and get everything working as well as possible before I actually start learning more about laser engraving.  I like to know my machines so I know how to repair them when they break. Like with drones, if you don't build it yourself, what are ya gonna do when ya crash it?? LOL  It's much harder to learn on a machine that isn't up to par.  We all know going in that these machines are good, but need upgrades to be great.  So far, I have mine running Marlin on a SKR1.4t.  With TMC2209s, its super quiet and both drivers and motors stay cool.  Having lots of inputs and outputs gives me lots of options for firmwares or things like Gcode/Macro Button control of case lighting and the red dot.  I'm working on adding a relay board today so I can do the same with air and water pump etc.  I added the smallest gas strut I could find to the door bc I accidentally slammed it shut a couple times lol.  I also ran an LED strip with a micro switch on the control side so it comes on like a fridge when I open the door LMAO.   It has been a bit of a bumpy road with Marlin though, so once I'm happier with my config ans engraving speeds, I'll share it so it's easier for others to use inexpensive boards like this instead of the pricey ones.  I believe Smoothie may even be more appropriate for lightburn and will run on SKR/MKS... Will find out later haha.  I haven't added air assist yet because I'm hesitant to order the wrong pump in effort to save $ and still debating, but it's time so I have to choose a compressor asap.  \n\nI really enjoy your work brother.

I am in search of a laser that can Etch through powder coating. My biggest issue is that the product is large and I would need a pass-through system or some way to Etch in the middle of the product. I have been looking at the Orion Motor Tech 60W, but how do you think that might compare to the FSL Muse Core 2D with Hobby Kit?",

You are NOT able to change mesh export settings and if you get model with ugly faceted surfaces because of that and you cant render it = there's no solution. \nTHAT level of bullshitness for payed software?

    "text": "I have had my Muse 3D for about eight months now.  As a machine and a piece of hardware I agree with your review:  this is an outstanding machine that looks great, is well designed and solidly built and cuts and engraves extremely well.  As with any complex device, you will encounter difficulties with various things (such as alignment and belt adjustment),  but their customer service has been outstanding and such issues are totally normal with any laser.\n\nMy issue with the Muse is  the software that runs it: re3.  In my hands, this is a horrible piece of software that is slow,  non-intuitive, confusing, constantly freezes my laptop, and is so frustrating to use that I may in fact sell my Muse because of the constant battles I have had with the software. I consider myself proficient with software and have used numerous programs, but at every turn, I have found difficulties with re3.   Interestingly,  re3 looks very similar to Lightburn,  but Lightburn is extremely well designed, intuitive, and  is an absolute joy to use.  It just has a polished \"feel\" and ease of use that re3 totally lacks.  In my opinion, re3 is a high school software project while Lightburn is sleek, professional and easy.  If only re3 were as well \"built\" as the Muse itself this would be an awesome combination. \n\nOne thing I have learned , and one should consider when buying a laser, is that when you purchase a proprietary device such as the Muse or the Glowforge for example, (I don't know anything about the Dremel)  you are totally dependent on the software and interface supplied by the respective companies.  For example, if Glowforge should fold as a company, your laser would be completely useless as it runs only via the company internet.  Although the Muse would not suffer a similar fate as the re3 software is on the machine, if you like re3, great, but if you don't, you are stuck.  So basically, by going with a proprietary machine you are exchanging the convenience of a \"plug and play\" device (obviously a great advantage) but totally giving up any flexibility or controlof the machine  to the respective company.\n\nI sincerely hope FS Laser comes out with a useful re3 update soon.",

Are you aware of any of the following plugins; curviloft, sub d tools, flowify, soap,  bezier spline, curic stretch, fredo box stretch etc. There are so many plugins in sketchup that are extremely powerful for quick organic manipulation. I think there are some great points about fusion here but it's a poor comparison video because you don't talk about sketchup pro, why just talk about sketchup, sketchup pro is really where the power is, not sketchup because it's about the available plugins that are within sketchup that are incredible. You certainly don't have to go and do things from scratch like you mention in your video. I would say that after watching this and the lack of these comments that I've just mentioned that this video is a poor comparison video and you should perhaps be informed well on both products before you generalize the two together in a comparison because it's very confusing for people like in your comments section who are unsure about which they need for their modelling projects.",

    "text": "Thanks for very informative information, I have autodesk licenses through my company, but not for fusion 360, I have need for others of there CAD software from time to time, they resently changed there network license to personal wich almost trippled my companys anual fee for something I need seldom, but when I need it I need it bad and can't be without it. For my personal use I used sketchup for the last 10 years or, so not realising the time saved with putting effort into parametric design, witch would have saved me alot of time with small changes in the design prosess with limitations of payed version. I am personally no converting to freeCAD and blender to mix my personal use since it is opensource and seems to have strong community. Of what I seen on youtube freeCAD can give me my needs for personal use and much more than I need without worring about license changes. Of cource many non autodesk files have caused problems in work since autodesk recognises that and put problems in import of what should be a standard format. Easier 3D modeling software are good to see what you need, but I wish I found parametric design software alot earlier, learning curve is alot steper, but only after a few models I see the win of making that extra effort. So to summary my thoughts, non parametric designs are if you have simple shapes you want and make one design and stick with it, if you have designs that can change small dimesions made in earlie stage without to mouch work go with parametric. Wiched I gone parametric now many years erlier. My finall thougt is that if you are planning to make future with 3D software and modelling for commersial use and get job in company, yes autodesk is most common and used around the world, but if you are a hobbyist or a small company protect your self about changes in future and look at opensorce prosjekts like freeCAD and Blender. I do pay for licenses when needed, but for non company use I only pay for the licenses needed, I try to keep paying atleast 1/3 to opensorce prosjekts if there is equivalent I can use to support further development. Even as smal programmer I believe that the creator sets the price, big or small creator , if you use product respect license conditions, support what you belive in. My first experience with autodesk I think is about 30 years ago with first computer lessons in architektural computing, autodesk has a stayed on top since then for comersial use along trimples sketchup with promise of free use for hobby , sorry to say I think commercial software as they think they won ground in uff they restrict the free for non commecial use to the  point it's  useless to hobbiest use. even if changes wan't as bad as most makers of youtube made it and thanks for that with your information, that where very informative, I still for personal use look for mor long terme stable solution for you as hobbist, for me it would be easier to keep to one, autodesk do not let me keep my persona fredom as hobbyist and my hobby programs to intergrate with my work at this time. So finalising my thoughts. Yes for work I need to keep up with Autodesk, but for my fredom in private I now fokus for freeCAd and blender, even thou reworking my models from sketchup that I need is a pain, putting alot of effort into lerning software that suddenly changes conditions is a pain, so as coclusion if you read all of this thoughts is,, if your going for learning for work at companies, this is good thing, but as hobbiest for your own use it is better to keep to opensource without restrictions. With my computer being both my personal and working I see complexity in many problems of free and non free versions, but I pay anual taxes for my personal computer and my own computer being the same, the same goes from my telephone that my company pais for and I get taxes for and can't get sirin sevices because of that. If you are new to parametric design I recommend freeCAD and put effort into that, if you plan yor 3D moddeling as work, definitly go with fusion 360. I would surtinality make good thougt about making in freeCAD and 360 videos in future compared to make same in fusion 360, my company gives me licenses if I say I need them without quistion, thats there fault, most licenses could be avoided so investors are at total loss. I do not care about that, if anyone been reading throuhg this it is about proos and con I can think of, there is no simple answer. No english is not my first language, nor do I intend it to be, best regards from Sweden. With all kritics it still the best informative video of fusion 360 autodesk changes in users agrement and priviliges. If anyone gotten throgh my thoughts definitly watch this video and make your desision made of information and need of use",

The bug was still in existence as of January (the last time I forgot and sent something directly to my printer to print full size).  You send something to a printer (full size, everything set correctly to print 1:1), and Fusion prints at something like 93% scale for no reason.  I printed several patterns, used them to cut out the parts I was making, and about 6 hours later I realized everything was undersized.  The workaround was to create a PDF, then print THAT at 1:1 and it works fine.",

That's very hard to follow because the mouse cursor is small and while you move over other stuff, Fusion highlights irrelevant things. There are a couple of occassions where you say \"click here and here\" within maybe half a ssecond and I am left wondering what just happened.\nHow about \"click here *on the front pane of the bottom component* [stop for half a second and only move the mouse very slightly] and then click here *on the back pane of the bottom component [stop again for a short while]\" Thanks a lot!",

There are a few areas where friction is being added to keep people from abusing the free version to create designs as a business.  The uproar around the changes have been a little bit overblown.... and why I went with a crazier thumbnail and title ;)",
