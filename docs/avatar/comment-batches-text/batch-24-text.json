There were a lot of ways to contact them to have them get back to you, but no way to actually find out the price without them having your contact info and being able to possibly spam you with sales calls. Maybe I'm the only one, but that makes this a non-starter for me. I used to teach laser cutting at a maker space on a $75,000 laser cutter (I did not own it), so I know they can get up there, and I'm sure this one is no where near that. But, I'm not going to jump through hoops to find out.\n\nSome people will say, \"Well, if you have to ask, you can't afford it.\" Except that if you are a small shop, and have a budget, it is actually possible that you could afford it, and you would like to know so you can set aside the money,.......   \n\nIt's more like, \"If your potential customer has to ask, then you probably shouldn't be hiding it.\"",

    "text": "Thank you for tackling what could be a thorny subject. Personally I always love to listen to reviewers' takes on the machines and I usually form some opinion using an aggregate of reviews. And even this only forms part of my overall opinion. Reviews are great but they never take the place of doing your own hard research. And you have to accept that MOST of these lasers are built in part or in whole in China where the quality is not always consistent. So no matter what you do you may end up with a bad sample of an otherwise good laser. I am much more concerned about the company I am buying from and their customer service than the actual laser itself 99% of the time.\n\nBut that being said I do thing the reviews have value as long as nobody doing them tries to hide the fact that they received the laser for free for review. Honesty and openness are the requirement for these reviews to have any merit. You have never given me any reason to think you are otherwise so I love following your channel.",

    "text": "I watch you regularly, and expected that your knowledge level would be a bit higher. First, she talks about the speed. Owning an Epilog Fusion Pro, I know something about speed. At top speed and max output power, you are hardly leaving a mark on wood. So, the speed argument is a little dumb. The accordions on the side of the gantry to protect the internals of the machine is something Epilog has had for years. The idea that somehow, the autofocus built-in to the lens carriage is something new is also wrong. Epilog, Trotec, and honestly several others I can think of have been doing that for years. Servo motors? Welcome to 2020. Let's talk resolution. 1000 DPI, is nowhere near class-leading. She talks about how happy she is about how rigid they are, being built of steel. Why did they add several hundred pounds to the machine by cheapening out with steel when they should have gone with military grade aluminum. I notice that my Epilog is under 300 pounds while the Aeon with the same bed size is 550 pounds. Some of them go up to 1,500 pounds. She talks about being able to change frequency, well I am not certain, but I think several companies have had that for years. I know I can change that on mine. The drop-in water cooled tube that doesn't change alignment is cool, bravo on that point! Even if you could buy one, (many people can not get a regular Mira for months) some interviews have said their Signature series (the only one that can boast all of this speed and ceramic RF core) is not even on the horizon for 4 to 6 months. Last thing is price. Who in the name of all that is holy is going to pay Epilog prices for a Chinese machine? I think it is just a reverse engineered Epilog or Trotec. There was a time when I would have looked at an Aeon or Thunder, but they were just too slow for my production needs. And please, add an LCD screen! What a strange place to try to save a buck, the one thing you will touch EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU USE THE LASER!",

So i just got on the easter sale, i do think there is a big gap between just the base machine and what they are actually selling. Like the riser base was tossed on with everything. But going with max config and having thr conveyer adds a whole lot more working area than others.",

Most of the features such as symbols, shapes, and most of the other features is tuned off. And very limited to two types of fonts.

The Fire extinguisher module option. The conveyor system module which allows for 10 FEET material.Do all the other machines offer this?

Before fully understanding the logic used to control the laser, I was surprised to see that machines with 600 to 1,000 mm speeds could only produce parts at roughly the same run time as machines with a maximum speed of 300 to 400 mm. The reason is that the faster machines have to overshoot the work area when ramping up and slowing down.\n\nUltimately, the best choice of laser comes down to (1) the purpose you intend to use it for (cutting or fine engraving) and (2) how fast it can perform the required task.",

For example, the Roly requires removal of several tiny screws to clean the lens and shroud, while others use magnets and other methods. For me, difficult maintenance could be a deal breaker.",

So what’s the deal? Are these good or are they garbage? Any input would be appreciated as spending a grand or so on any gear at the moment is a bit of an expense for me currently. I can’t afford to be throwing money away on a product that’s going to work for a week and then fail on me.

Using its wireless, the Roly can act as a web server.  I load designs onto a micro SD, make the Roly act as a web server and I use the browser on my phone to tell the Roly which file to cut.",
