Given i already have a D1 and Lightburn works perfectly with it, I had no reason to assume Lightburn wouldn't work with the P2 with the exception of the explicitly stated limitations above.  I can understand not having the curve support, but all other functions should be available. Also, the XCS software is horrible. I would not expect it to be on par with LIghtburn, but there are a multitude of little things like being able to easily define layers or remove the close up view when not needed. All in all, unless you are happy to only work in XCS (assuming full support for Lightburn never comes), save your money and buy another brand CO2 (Monoport, Omtech) and get a fiber laser to go with it for what you pay for the P2. I am posting this comment not as a criticism of the this video, but in the hopes that someone watching this video in trying to decide whether to buy the P2 or not, are more fully informed. I did a fair amount of research before buying the P2 and everyone either intentionally or unknowingly failed to mention just how limited LIghtburn for P2 is nor just how bad the XCS software is.",

When the beam had penetrated a millimeter into the material, one would need to lower the focus by that millimeter, but then some \"sideways\" rays that come at angle wouldn't reach deep into the groove and will hit the material around the groove instead. Heating and possibly graying them. Is there a place where I can find explanations on that matter?",

You are getting a sub from me!\nI have been looking at getting a 3D printer, but had to put the purchase on pause due to another big purchase (an affordable house!) and then this bad boy dropped! My partner got excited and asked me if i would rather save up a little more money and then get this 2 in one, because i would like to try laser cutting but its not my main focus and the machines are rather expensive. \nSo here i am trying to research if the printer is worth it or not and from your review, which was sooo much more helpful since you know the details about laser cutting and most other reviewers are 3D printers, and i think i feel like this is a 100% the route i should go, i get to have the 3D printer i wanted but as an added bonus i can play around with the laser cutter function and it sounds like the quality and what you get is quite good even though the size is a trade off.\nBut i am also a hobbyist, i love trying my hand at many hobbies and i don't think i need a bigger surface to cut on to begin with, so honestly it really sounds like a great fit for someone like me, who needs the 3D printer but would love to try a laser cutter too :)",
