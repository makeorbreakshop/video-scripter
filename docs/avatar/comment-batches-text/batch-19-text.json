Some diode lasers are advertised to be able to run up to 24000mm/min, which is equal to 400mm/s, so theoretically they could do the same as CO2 laser. Perhaps in case of 300mm/s even 40w optical power would not be enough fo good result, but I am confused why people are not running such tests on yt - usually they go up to 10000mm/min.",

Kind of pointless to buy the pro when its only for the rail system and it would be waste of the laser. I wish they offered a complete 40w kit. Im considering throwing my hat into the co2 ring and going with an Omtech 50w. Currently its $250 off so its pretty close to the same price if I would purchase the pro and then the 40w upgrade.

    "text": "I think there is a lot of nuance in getting the right laser cutter. The Polar looks like an interesting machine and I might be interested if I was getting something for my house. I'm a teacher and the Glowforge works best for my classroom. The footprint is just right for the classroom (looks similar to the Polar). The web interface is a selling point, allowing us to manage multiple users easily and not worry about software. I only use the interface to set up my cuts, where the camera is very useful. Everything else is done in Illustrator, Inkscape, or Vectornator. The subscription is completely optional and unnecessary. Respectfully, the review makes it sound almost required - that is simply incorrect. I have 5 Glowforges (the plus model). They are used constantly, the oldest being 3 years old, and I have never had a serious problem with any of them. Support was quick and helpful when an issue did present itself, the GF was cutting again by the end of the day. It is a no fuss machine - and that is what I need when working with 100 students each quarter. If I were buying a hobby machine I would have different requirements, but the Glowforge is pretty awesome for us. Just wanted to provide a different perspective/experience.",

The M1 spec states a 385x300mm (15x12 inch) working area, but is that the max size of the material sheet BEFORE cutting or just the max size of the cutting area?  For example, can I insert a sheet of 8mm MDF into the unit that is say 400x310mm and then design a shape to cut inside the 385x300 working area?  The reason I ask is that the shape I need to produce could be 300x300mm so it would be nice to be able to rough cut a slightly larger sheet to then make sure the finished shape can be cut out allowing for a small border.  Hope that makes sense?",

Although we all can agree that the xTools are great machines, but I don't understand why anyone would chose these xTool lasers at peaking up to $2,500 dollars for for a 20 Watt laser,  when you can buy a Genmitsu L8 40 Watt laser at speeds 40000 mm/min... super fast with LightBurn?",
