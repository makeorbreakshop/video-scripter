    "text": "I find it crazy that people buy into the unshielded lasers expecting anything good to come of it. The only laser cutter/engraver I have experience with was a massive unit with full shielding and multiple warning stickers about the dangers of laser radiation. These unshielded units are either not powerful enough to do what they advertise, or they are dangerously leaking radiation into your surroundings and you should probably discontinue using it. Generally, a laser above 5mw is enough to cause eye damage if directly shone into your eyes, and lasers above around the 250mw range can cause temporary eye damage indirectly in large exposure. Above 500mw, the damage is permanant. \n\nThese units are often claiming their lasers are \"40W\", which is 80 times the limit for permanent eye damage. This makes the lasers about 9 times more dangerous to handle for the end user. At this level, indirectly viewing the beam or the landing point of the beam will damage your eyes, likely permanantly. The wave length of the laser doesn't change much about the danger to your eye sight, as even undetectable in the UV and IR wave lengths will blind you. Non-visable-light-based lasers (say that 5 times fast) are often more dangerous as you don't even have any reflexes to mitigate the damage. Visable light lasers will cause your eye to reflexively close, which limits the exposure time and chance of blindness. IR and UV wavelengths don't trigger this response, so you won't know anything is wrong until your eye starts hurting which means the exposure time is already exceeding three times the normal amount for visable light, if not more so. Don't cheap out on laser tech, it's dangerous.",

So to replace your tube cost you a few thousand dollars, or a bearing, or any other part you can't get from somewhere else.\n\n2. One thing I that wasn't clear in the \"Connectivity\" section, which machines force you to be connected to their cloud before they let you use it?  That is a HUGE deal breaker for me.  If the internet, or your router, or their server, is down so is your laser???  Not going to happen.  \n\nIf a company has that much control over whether or not you can use your machine that will eventually come around to screw you, guaranteed.  At some point that company is going to want you to pay for it's cloud, meaning a new monthly subscription service.  At any time that company could go out of business making your laser a super expensive paper weight.  Look at how many Youtube vids are out there highlighting how their projects were delayed, or completely ruined because Adobe's servers crashed so Premier locked up.  \n\nBoth of these issues make a huge difference in which lasers are usable/affordable.",

The reason is because glowforge does not run gcode, it does not and cannot accept gcode, so it's impossible for any software to interface with it.  Everything has to go through their website.  Also you have to pay a monthly fee to do anything but the very basics with their software.  If you want to cut a square, for example, through their software, that is considered a premium feature and you have to pay for that feature.\n\nBut glowforge does do passthrough nicely.\nAlso glowforge has some nice features that you've missed.  For example it detects if you cut anything that will create poison gas that will kill you.  An absolute must if you're going to put this in a classroom where a kid might be vinyl in the machine. That feature alone would make the glowforge the only option for many IMHO.",

The cheaper the entry level into business (and 5K is beyond cheap) the more people are going to be in your space and for that reason...you should really have an idea of how you are going to make a profit BEFORE you buy the laser.  This is way more important than the price differences between the laser.  You can come back from spending to much if you have a great idea.  You will not come back from getting a great deal on a laser if you have no idea how you are going to turn a profit.

I love in the bigger equipment they claim to have the best support, what they mean is the best support if they feel it is convenient for them and no cost to them. They know most can't do anything to hold them accountable for their statements or claims. I found its common for them to do things like if they were advertising a car they would put a 1mm gas line then claim the car travels at 180 MPH when in fact the gas travels at 180MPH down the gas line and not the car.",

Im used to working a Glowforge Pro and im nervous about a steep learning curve with other printers. \nWith that said im really close to pulling the trigger on an Xtool P2 but I discovered the Thunder Laser USA Thunderbolt RF co2 laser and now I'm really torn between the two machines.  I really like that the Xtool looks a lot easier to use than the Thunder Laser and isnt as tall but i want the best machine i can get for what i need.  Quality is super important but i need to be able to use the software too.  \n\nIm really torn as this is a huge investment.  \n\nCurrently i use ImagR to process all of my photos to engrave and import them. \n\nCan you offer your insight? Thanks in advance!",
