    "text": "There are a HUGE difference when it comes to power and the way Thunder Laser USA advertises the tubes provided. A 100watt Thunder has 10-20% more power than a 100watt Omtech or similar laser. As a example if you buy a 100 watt co2 laser from most manufacturers the tube has a MAXIMUM output of 100 watts but you are only recommended running them at 90% of the advertised power. Thunder Laser USA sell 100watt lasers with a usable output of 100watts. They throttle the power back from (in my case) 118 watts maximum output and this allows you to set the power to 100% in lightburn and get a true 100watt output with no risk of damage to the tube.",

Glad you finally got one!\n\nThere's two things that I would like to note - the doors require a key to open, which is annoying. All I need is a latch. I don't understand why the doors are keyed when the main lid isn't. \n\nThe other issue is not having a guide that corresponds to the bounds of the cutting area. For example, you will see a ruler on the X and Y axis. You can push material up to it and know exactly where it is every time. Trotec and epilog both have ruler guides in some of their cutting tables.\n\nEveryone's got a different workflow though. I personally use absolute coords 98% of the time.

You are basically paying 2000$ for shipping software.  The cooling system is sub par, and being locked into their software to use the features is a gimmic.   If this company really wanted a consumer audience,  they would work with the popular sw companies to integrate the support they provide and also sell a product with better hardware.   This laser is being sent out in hopes to nab a few 1 off customers but geared at businesses that do not know better or want a mini laser farm.  Not including the software or time, an identical laser built with better quality parts would cost about 2k currently.   Yes it would not look as nice, but 3000$ extra just so you don't have to alignment your work is insane.  Also any business that would be using lasers, will definitely be concerned about time and ensure to align everything well to get the most bang for their buck.\n\nIn short... great idea, horrible price, wrong targeted market.\n\nUse better hardware and reduce the price by 50% and then you will be in the right audience and market.",

All things considered, the P2 seems like a step up from the OMTech Polar but one thing that I think you failed to mention in the price comparison is that the Rotary for the P2 is an additional cost, whereas the rotary is included in the cost of the Polar. In your prior reviews it seems like you are pretty high on the Polar. All things considered, which of the two would you personally recommend (I know everyone's needs are different, looking for your choice personally). To add to that, if space is not a constraint, is there are full size laser in the price range of the Polar and P2 that you would recommend above the others?",

The example engraving you showed wasn't nearly large enough to make use of the speed. That is, as soon as it gets to the engrave, it should already start slowing down. Now, to bypass that, there's the overscan area, which is this case is excessively large because it needs a long time to reverse that heavy head. \n\nLong story short; Top speeds are nice and all, but pretty meaningless without high accelerations to make use of it.",

All the reviews i have seen keep showing a window with pre set calculations as a guide to show you what the settings should be for different materials...mine does not have any such window!  The hardware looks good but it can only excel if its software is well thought out...THIS ISN'T. it is very frustrating and to cap it all i have just tried to leave a product review on Amazon but strangely Amazon keep telling me they can't find the product i purchased new just one week ago?.. all my other purchases are still there waiting to be reviewed .I I wonder if they are getting a lot of returns.",

I've seen the fiber lasers are much better for aluminium.  There is also some evidence from youtube the fiber lasers can also now cut carbon fibre.  However, I can't find many reviews using the fiber lasers to cut carbon fibre.  In short, I'm wondering if only a MOPA fiber laser can cut carbon fiber?  If you could let me know your thoughts that could make a big difference to me.  Looks like the 'Max' fiber lasers are also best avoided!",

For the adaptive clearance cnc bit - one obviously needs to probe Z top height and X & Y outer corners (based on the stock corner chosen or box point); but for the parallel path the cnc bit is changed to a bullnose - and while one does need to probe again Z tool height again, do we also need to probe the outer corners X & Y again? .....It can get a little confusing when you consider that the silhouette cut for the adaptive clearance bit is set to \"tool outside boundary\", while the parallel path bullnose bit chosen is set to \"tool centre on boundary\". Does fusion just do the calculation for you when you go from one bit to the next \"for the x & y box point\", or does one have to probe X & Y again (in addition to Z) for each cnc bit change?",

We had machines in the hundreds of thousands of dollars range, even a few into a million dollar range. ESI was a brand, from China I believe, that we had that did UV lasers. Another was the Excellon Cobra which had both UV and CO2 in 1 machine so you could cut/skive/drill with one and do a finish pass with the other. Or a multilayer panel with different materials like copper and dielectric. Cool stuff. Have been thinking about getting a laser engraver for some product ideas I have",

The 40w requires a different power cable and they haven't made one long enough for the extension yet and will not be available for several weeks. They don't tell you this, so I am sharing here.",
