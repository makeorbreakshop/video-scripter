For example, your bit on mirroring the table legs, I was following along and found mine wouldn't work - I got \"Compute failed\" and \"One or more patterns could not be intersected...\" etc. I googled it and found it's because you've got to change Pattern Type from \"Faces\" to \"Components\" in the mirror window.

The X-Carve CNC Milling Machine in my basement ( https://imgur.com/a/04LhFJN ) has had an *Opt Lasers PLH3D-6W-XF* Laser Head attached to it which trust a LOT more being what it is marketed as than anything else coming from the Asian regions of the world ( Unless it had _Made in Japan_ stamped on it ). I also think what most people miss out on is that those Lasers don't just pose a threat to your sight when looking into the Laser with line of sight but they also pose an issue with reflections ( light bouncing off a mirror ) and refractions ( shining a strong flashlight _through_ your hand ). Besides THAT there's also the issue with cutting certain materials - Laser cutting ABS, as an example, will emit Cyanide!",

Tried everything and apparently the laser itself has failed so I attempted to contact support at GearBest. This is where it has gone terribly wrong - they simply do not respond to requests of any kind. Is that because of Covid19? Don't think so as I could live chat with them, they are sending out advertising emails, and there is nothing on their site about the Coronavirus. So, the live chats end with \"you will be contacted in this regard in 24 hours or less\" which I have been told on three separate occasions and received nothing. Opened tickets on their support site are closed without any followup within a day or two and sent emails that go unanswered. \n\n\nNice.\n\n\nSo I would stay away from this product and GearBest.com at all costs and just spend the extra money on a real laser engraver rather than this junk from China. You get what you pay for.\n\n\nBTY, I submitted a dispute to my credit card company and they have refunded my money - even they couldn't make contact with this outfit.",

I can get quite a bit done. Sketch-u-cam helps a lot. It's a bit limited and buggy too.\n\nIt's a bit early in the game but F360 looks quite promising. I'm already doing things in it that would be completely hairy in sketchup.\n\nI'm going to argue that Sketchup is great at the beginning since you can get going pretty fast with it and there's a reasonable gamut of stuff you can do with it using a 2.5D methodology. Great for the dating stage with your cnc machine. \n\n\nBut if you are going to marry your cnc machine a person should add F360 to the mix. You'll be able to delve deeper.",

    "text": "Some nice information! However, I'm still not convinced... Lots of the stuff you showed like resizing the countertop and drawer can be done very quickly in Sketchup as well. I see all these tables and screens full of dimensions and numbers, but I think with some experience you will be faster in Sketchup in the end, since it's so easy to use.\n\n\nFor the organic sculpting there are very good and simple to use plugins for Sketchup. And as for printing, Sketchup can export directly to STL as well, I use it for 80% of my printer modeling (and some blender sometimes). The built-in slicer in Fusion is cool, but if you're used to a normal slicer like Cura or Slic3r already, this doesn't have much more value over using Sketchup.\n\n\nAbout rendering...  I actually use Sketchup for this professionally,  with a plugin called Twilight Render. It may not be as powerful as for example Vray ( which also costs an insane amount of money), but it can make REALLY realistic renders, better than anything i've seen coming out of Fusion.\n\n\nNow... I'm not saying that Fusion is bad; If you want to do some complex and organic modeling and product design, though it can be done, it's not very easy in Sketchup. For extremely parametric stuff, like the lego bricks you showed us, this will be better as well. But I still think people really write off Sketchup too quickly, and often overlook what that piece of software can do with some additional plugins, ESPECIALLY for interior design and non-organic stuff like that. The workflow and interface sure are infinitely more intuitive and simple than any other modeling software out there...\n\n\nYou're free to use what you want of course, both are valid options, but don't underestimate Sketchup if you like a really hands-on and intuitive workflow.",

If you don't want to use bleach, then at least add fish tank bio killer in the water to prevent it from going stagnant over time.  Using antifreeze or \"water wetter\" products and the like is bad, because it cooks into the glass and actually will eventually build heat on the tube, as will minerals in the water if it's not pure distilled.

    "text": "Also, worth noting, those included glasses aren't rated for the laser on the machine. The tint vs color of the laser is a dead giveaway. If you look at any laser engraver and many high powered laser pointers of similar wavelength, the protective shielding or goggles are orange. It's basically a principle of opposing colors. It helps if you think of the color of the goggles cancelling out the color of the laser. In this case, the blue laser light is extremely close to the green goggles on the color wheel. The goggles let light in and around the green wavelength through. For the goggles to be effective in blocking the blue laser light, they should be red, or preferably orange, the opposing color to blue. \n\nSince they aren't clear or blue goggles, they are probably blocking some of the harmful light, but I definitely wouldn't trust my vision to them, especially if they were included free with a cheap and cheerful, safety measure delete laser engraver.\n\nEdit: It might be worse than I thought...I was just basing this off of a combination of my knowledge of optics, confirmed by the high end laser related products I've seen. I just looked it up and found this video. It looks like he has a pair of the included glasses, and they fail to even block an LED, so if you're staring at the laser light, you're probably roasting your retinas.\nhttps://youtu.be/upCsVrKrW7M\n\nHe also has an epic accent.\n\nEdit 2: Here's a video that goes more into depth on what you should look for in goggles to protect yourself. I am pretty confident that the ones included above are just green plastic, with no laser rating whatsoever. If one is listed, I'd be willing to bet that it's utter BS.\n\nLong and short of it, if you're gonna save a buck on your laser engraver, don't skimp on the PPE to go along with it. Or you'll be giving yourself anti-lasik.\n\nFinal Edit: I'm also only considering the harmful potential of the unshielded laser module. This is ignoring the carcinogen laden fumes it's outputting. There is a reason laser cutters are enclosed both behind laser shielded material AND have their own filtration and extraction systems. This could also very easily start a fire if you're not watching it like a hawk, and even if you are, I can see a mosquito fart knocking it over, or it overshooting the material it's engraving and scorching the surface beneath it. \n\nAs much as I want a laser cutter, this seems like a bad idea. 3d printers and CNC routers are one thing to downsize and lose all the safety gear. The damage they can do is pretty limited to localized burns and possibly losing a digit to a router bit. Laser cutters are next level dangerous.",
