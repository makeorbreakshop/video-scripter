The darkest areas are engraved the deepest and as the shades of gray get lighter, the laser engraves with less power creating a 3D effect. Is there any way to manipulate the map data to do this. I know it's kind of a tough question but I'm trying to get more into this. Thanks.",

I think it goes for $1500 (I bought the kickstarter so its obviously a diff price) and I recommend it when ease of use and safety is accounted for. Research your seller to make sure good customer service is available. I haven't had problems and I've used it for about 8 months regularly. I also never cut at 50% to help save my CO2 laser, but thats a personal pref. Never look directly at lasers, always get glasses but you still shouldn't look directly at it with glasses on either.  Also research what materials you are cutting because gases released can be harmful if youre ignorant of what you're cutting. Hope this helps and glhf :)",

Few daunting parts about \"you'll have to get all this dialed yourself\" when I know nothing about the program is a little intimidating, but I just followed your lead and am about to go try and cut this thing. Also side note, I took a screen shot of fusion 360, threw it in illustrator and just did a trace draw and deleted the paths inside, and it did seem to go a little quicker (Even though I lost my scale tool bar and couldn't figure out how to bring it back up) but also was way more precise on the edges (or so it seems, will let you know after the cut).

If the galvo head is coupled to a wire source (or other pump configuration), the galvo head should be easily movable relative to the diode bank (my understanding is that fiber optic fibers/wires/cables are flexible and durable).  if the gantry could move the galvo head over a large area, that might also mitigate the other con of galvo heads you mentioned (sub optimal angles at limits of galvo head), because the galvo head wouldn‚Äôt need to be pushed to reach as far to yield a work area that seems competitive (it could stay within an optimal angular range relative to the travel of and on the gantry).

I will say that since seeing them introduce the subscription service and push it so hard, I've had the constant sneaking worry that one day they'll try and lock all function of my glowforge behind a paywall, but so far they haven't done that.  I only ever upload designs so I have no need for the subscription.  If they ever do decide to brick it for a subscription (or go under and their webclient ceases to be), I'll look at other companies, but I can't afford to upgrade as long as I've got a working laser already.\n\nDespite my overall very positive experience with glowforge, I don't think I'd recommend them to someone now, when you can get a more powerful laser that can run in house software for less money.  When it was 2k, it was also one of the only really user friendly lasers on the market, and one of the cheapest lasers.

In fact, they didn't even read my email, which asked about being able to buy the on/off pushbutton switch that is sticking, and their response was to ignore me.  I asked to pay for a service call.  At this point I have actually convinced two people to buy a competitors model and I am working on my third person.  I purchased the laser and requested support from the Anaheim California location, but I have not seen anything to let me know that the entire company is not represented by the same lousy service.  I would be fine with their lack of help, but even when I asked if there was anyone who could help, I was met with silence.  I was finally able to find someone who does service for Laser in LA, and I was happy to pay for the help.  I am very disgusted with Omtech's complete lack of service.

I also own a zf3551, a FSL PS20, and a custom-built 5w UV.  \n\nI bought it thinking I could use it as a semi-portable.  \n\nHere's my thoughts:\n\n1) Not really meant to be portable.  \n2) Very fast from uncrating to lasering.\n3) In Lightburn, unless I'm missing something, the focus (z-offset) has to be set for every layer.\n4) Camera calibration was easy - except a bit inaccurate (so I guess not as easy as it seemed).  It would not even detect the dot pattern unless I opened the lid part way.  It seemed like Lightburn doesn't like the 180 pano camera lens, but this is my first machine with a camera.   I'll fiddle more tomorrow.",
