Fusion is amazing software and even in it's throttled back form, it is a priviledge for the freeloaders to be a ble to use it. I have paid over $40,000 (Australian)  for Solidworks over the years and that is cheap compared to ProEngineer (Creo) and UniGraphics that preceeded it, but Fusion is way superior, especially if you need to use CNC etc, the Delcam / FeatureCam / HSMWorks tech rolled into Fusion is outrageously good for the price.

I have a Cricut Maker cutting machine and it doesn't cut precisely and small enough which is why I'm looking for a laser cutter instead. The most common materials I would cut would be around 2mm or less, matboard to thin wood.\n\nI'm 33 but I find technology to be a little annoying. It's not my favorite thing to figure out software and do upgrades. I don't think I'm even capable. So I need something user friendly that I can use with SVG files.",

Because of the COVID virus we have now lost the only place I would have gone to look at and ask questions about it.  That is FRY's Electronics.  I was going to build a newer computer with newer components.  I like to buy locally and now there is no second choice place to go.  The whole printing and engraving environment is changing so fast I have been deliberately slow to get involved and jump in.  Would you be able to make suggestions on where to focus if I mentioned some of the criteria involved?  1)  Engrave small objects like in the size of Keys, Knife handles and up to the size of 6 inches square for just a little more versatility;  2)  Because of size - price should be small due to the versatility and usefulness is reduced (comparatively);  3)  Precision - due to the size of the engravings they will be examined closely.  4)  Engrave or etch but NOT cut through.  5) Small because of my needs and can't have it take up a lot of room.   6)  Engrave any metals that will dis-color noticeably. \n\nAll these are valid reasons that must be evaluated together.     If you can please give me a few suggestions.  Because I don't know what the prices may be, please consider price to be of the lesser requirement.  I want a good one that will do the job.
