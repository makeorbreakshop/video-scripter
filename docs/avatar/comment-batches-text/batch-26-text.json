    "text": "Absolutely save the money and buy a dedicated laser printer.  The difference that you didn't mention when you compared the additional cost  of the 40W Bambu when compared to just buying the S1 is the cut size.  The camera is a nice feature, but with the alignment functions of the S1 it is minimal.  Having roughly twice the cut capacity, plus having a dedicated machine is going to completely offset the few hundred dollar difference.  Plus, XCS is a great software solution on it's own for beginners, but you can use LightBurn on the S1 when you grow beyond the limited feature set you get with Bambu Studio.\n\nAdditionally, I guarantee that the more you use the laser, the more dirty the inside of the 3D printer is going to get.  Take a picture of the inside of a P2 or P2S that gets daily use and you'll see what I mean.\n\nFinally, the problem with having a shared machine is that when the H2D eventually has a failure, you lose all of your ability to work whereas if you have different machines, you can at least still do something.",

Once the laser module is sold separately (I didn't find it on their store at the time of writing), then you could buy one when/if you wanted one.

The rotary was broken and AtomStack replaced that within a week.  With the exception of the 3rd mirror adjustment at the laser head - difficult to adjust due to the air assist tubing and the auto focusing wires disconnecting regularly (faulty connecter), oh and the decision not to provide free shipping so I'm still out $400, the machine is actually pretty good so far.  Pro: very robust metal build, this thing is solid! Proprietary software is good, I use both that and Lightburn, depending on what I am doing, and it is pretty precise.  Cons: difficult lens adjustment (laser head design could have been a bit better at little extra effort), rotary accessories are workable but made of plastic and don't have the same sturdiness of the laser (honestly, it's a beast!), but they work, just be gentle with them.  Support is decent.  I ordered during the Dragon Festival so that holiday gummed up the customer service a bit.  Expect delays in response due to  being on the other side of the world and the language barrier... some of the replies were difficult to decipher due to the language barrier.  Overall - I'm growing to really like this machine.",

Anker also abandoned their slicer software and mobile app years ago. It was left in a pretty buggy state. They have also outsourced a lot of their support to members of their discord community and have almost no official interaction with customers there. Community members have had to build custom print profiles for orca because the default profiles were extremely poor and resulted in repeated print failures. There also have been multiple reports of customers returning defective printers under warranty and being sent back a barely functional refurbished unit with major problems. I am confident this product works well and based on what I see there's nothing else on the market similarly priced. Just keep in mind anker support is awful and they do not have any loyalty to you as a customer. They will abandon you the second this product appears to be a commercial failure.",

Just place the bottom piece first to get the right spot for engraving, lift up the machine on anything steady hard wood or so on and done. figure out the right height for being able to do the cutting properly and you're set. depending on the laser only if it is still strong enough to cut out properly.

    "text": "Being in school photography since 2016, I have lots of experience with printers. And the of the biggest issues are with the print head and ink.\n\n- Ink tends to dry out and clog. Any news on how thos is handled with the resin? I known it's UV resin and doesn't exactly dry out. But over time, it can still happen. Colored resin isn't just resin. There's still ink particles that can clump up when sitting idle.\n\n- The print head is easily the most annoying component. They shift and rare out over time. They're not easy nor cheap to replace. And it's not like we can just call a repair shop to come over and fix this one.\n\n- I've ran into far too many issues with the ink spilling all over the printhead and down onto the paper and internal components. How would that be addressed with this printer? Resin would be a lot more difficult to remove than traditional liquid or powder ink.\n\n- To add to that, how easy is it to repair/place the print bed components? The belt, the gears, etc?",

    "text": "If my limited knowledge about lasers is correct, the lower the wattage the smaller the laser point and the better for small engraving. I saw the demo on the 3D example and the steps. My question is this. With higher wattages on the Accalaser, will it be able to do smaller and more precise engraving? I'm wondering if the higher wattage are adjustable to your needs. I know power and speed go together, but you also want a precise and fine laser point when engraving smaller items. Just a point of view.",

Meaning, you must constantly be banging out prints or you eat up cleaning cartridges for simply sitting idle. I'm on edge about buying this machine because everyone talking good about it got it for free sponsored, and isn't exactly giving a truly bias opinion. Eufymake also dumped on their customers in the past launching products then killing support and dropping the product line all together. The only hope I have is that adam savage from tested used this so I'd hope it would mean it would be continuously used. If the self cleaning cartridges were cheap then not much of an issue. If some other china company sells cheaper inks, great, many headaches cost wise solved.",
