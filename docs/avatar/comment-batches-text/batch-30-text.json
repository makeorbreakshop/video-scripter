That doesn't show here at all.",

    "text": "Can the same CAD software be used, whether your final material is wood, plastic, or metal?\n\nFor example, some CAD software is tied to the shop that will fabricate it..  eMachineShop or Protocase Designer CAD..  but what if you want to do it first in a different material?\n\nWhat CAD software do you recommend?   From what' I've seen:\n\nFusion360 is great for design, but the cost/license might be a deal-breaker for many \nParametric (i.e. ability to undo as many steps as you want) is a must-have feature\nFreeCAD might be a bit difficult for the beginner\nOnShape supports exporting without having the $2500/year license\nPro/Corporate Users should stick with Siemens Solid Edge , Solidworks, Catia, Pro-Engineer\nThen there's other that don't have nearly as much users.. Moi3D, OctoPrint, etc.\n\nbut for most beginners, it seems TinkerCad and Plasticity are the solid choices?\n\nBTW, do you recommend any low-cost 3d printer service?  Sculpteo , Shapeways, CraftCloud, xometry, protolabs?  How about for CNC / Laser ?",

For detail work it really beats glass CO2 lasers by far. RF lasers can be operated from 0-100% duty cycle and a glass tube laser (10-15)-100%.",
