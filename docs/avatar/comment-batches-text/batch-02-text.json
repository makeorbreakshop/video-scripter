Called F.S. and got nothing. They had stopped making the main control board and offered NO assistance. Bought a new power supply and Main processor from Light Object and got machine back up and running. Quite different software to learn, but, now I prefer it. I CAN'T recommend F.S. for their customer service or warranty. Just had to replace an axis driver. Another $50 gone! Please do your OWN research!",

Most stamps require about 1 to 1.5mm of depth in cutting to differentiate the printable area from the not printable. I saw your review of the Ortur, and I can get one with a little more powerful laser. (20W instead of the 15W, which as you pointed out is really like 6 watts vs. 4 watts) Do you think that will do the job? Thank so much!",

But it wasn't that bad., WE covered it with some poly and it was horrible looking made it look faded even more??? no idea why? I put down a the butcher block oil on the butcher block before staining not a oil based pre stain. I have no idea but i am looking for idea on what to cover my stain with, i do NOT LIKE POLY at all.

I use inkscape (free)....and scorchworks (free) to use this K40 laser, and it works great....dont have to deal with chinese software.... you learn alot, the cost is super minumum.... if you dont like it, or you get bored with it, sell it on craigslist for  $200....lesson learned.\nsooooo. to wrap things up.....Couple years ago, i built my own. bigger and better c02 laser and still using free software. Cost me $1500 to make, and i have more than made up the cost to make it.....life treating me fine right now....retired. Learned off the K40, reading reviews, watching you-tube videos......then make your own.....cant tell you how many people have made their own.....a ton.",
