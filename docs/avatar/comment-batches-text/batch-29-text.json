After watching this video would you recommend an open diode laser on a gantry and get the fiber attachment when I wanted to engrave on metal accessories that I could add onto the hat? I am thinking the open diode gantry laser because then this could laser engrave an image all around the brim of the hat in one sitting, is that correct? I would like to engrave on the sides of the crown of the hat and the brim, so I am assuming with the open diode laser this could laser engrave all around the brim of the hat in a circle",

    "text": "Laser diodes are currently limited to about 5W of output power under ideal conditions, which means that any diode laser with a higher power will have multiple diodes. This introduces a problem in that it is very difficult to get all the beams lined up, so the beam is often not very well focused. You will note that I said OUTPUT power. The problem with a lot of diode lasers you might find on Aliexpress or Ebay is that the seller is listing the INPUT electrical power, which is usually about 4 to 5 times the output power. Yep, most of the input power gets turned into heat. \n\nA diode laser with a genuine 40W output will consume a least 160W, and will be turning about 120W of the input power into heat. That's if you actually have a 160W power supply for it. If it doesn't have a massive heatsink, it probably isn't a 40W laser.\n\nSo you need to be careful when buying a diode laser, particularly a cheap one from China. Your 40W diode laser is probably only giving you 5W or 10W of actual output power.",

The operation was good, but my biggest pet peeve is the undependability. With the one the laser died out after just under three years. I then got the refurbished unit, and the power stopped after just over one year. It would cost over $1000 to fix it. I’m looking for something, hopefully more dependable. I’m always afraid to take on a big job because what if it breaks down while doing it? All that said, what are your thoughts on the OneLaser’s dependability?",

I have my printers working in the same room that I am spending the day and it is not too bad regarding the fumes that 3D printers are generating. So can someone let me know how bad the fumes are for laser engraving and cutting wooden materials? I would consider the air purifier, but while reviewing those, it seemed that they are very loud and I could not work in the same room while the air purifier is working. And I can't really keep the window open all the time to get the fumes out constantly. So my question is - are the fumes from laser cutting and engraving worse than from the 3D printing? Or would it be fine if I opened the window for couple of minutes every few hours? I am currently looking at the Creality Falcon 2.",

Based on quotes for machines of the same size (1300mm), the OneLaser is about 24% more expensive than the Pronto, claims to be 20% faster, and offers the option of an RF laser. To my knowledge, neither machine uses servo motors like the Thunder Laser. It’s a very capable machine and may have better support than some competitors. However, it’s a new brand with no established track record, although it appears to be closely associated with Thunder Laser, which has a solid reputation. Definitely tempting.",

Even with shipping, it’s still super competitive compared to most professional lasers out there. What’s even better is that they’re planning to roll out extra features and lifetime upgrade options, which could turn this into the ultimate cabinet CO2 laser. It’s definitely shaping up to be a solid choice.\n\nOn the flip side, I’ve never used thunder machine but I had some experience with the OMTECH Pro series, and honestly, omtech services sucks, the speed didn’t match the advertised claims, and the bed would occasionally tilt, causing alignment issues and other issues here and there.—so I’m glad Onelaser stepping it up with a better game.\n\nWhat I really like about OneLaser is their U.S.-based team. They’re super responsive and actually take the time to answer questions properly, which you don’t see often. The only drawback? You’ve got to wait 2-3 months for inventory, but they’ve promised stock is on the way. Hopefully, they deliver on that soon!",
