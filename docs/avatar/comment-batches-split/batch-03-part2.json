If you don't want to use bleach, then at least add fish tank bio killer in the water to prevent it from going stagnant over time.  Using antifreeze or \"water wetter\" products and the like is bad, because it cooks into the glass and actually will eventually build heat on the tube, as will minerals in the water if it's not pure distilled.  Don't listen to these dopes.  I've been running home built units for years now and have done the research for 10 men.\nAlso invest in a CW-5000 chiller and be done with it.

    "text": "Also, worth noting, those included glasses aren't rated for the laser on the machine. The tint vs color of the laser is a dead giveaway. If you look at any laser engraver and many high powered laser pointers of similar wavelength, the protective shielding or goggles are orange. It's basically a principle of opposing colors. It helps if you think of the color of the goggles cancelling out the color of the laser. In this case, the blue laser light is extremely close to the green goggles on the color wheel. The goggles let light in and around the green wavelength through. For the goggles to be effective in blocking the blue laser light, they should be red, or preferably orange, the opposing color to blue. \n\nSince they aren't clear or blue goggles, they are probably blocking some of the harmful light, but I definitely wouldn't trust my vision to them, especially if they were included free with a cheap and cheerful, safety measure delete laser engraver.\n\nEdit: It might be worse than I thought...I was just basing this off of a combination of my knowledge of optics, confirmed by the high end laser related products I've seen. I just looked it up and found this video. It looks like he has a pair of the included glasses, and they fail to even block an LED, so if you're staring at the laser light, you're probably roasting your retinas.\nhttps://youtu.be/upCsVrKrW7M\n\nHe also has an epic accent.\n\nEdit 2: Here's a video that goes more into depth on what you should look for in goggles to protect yourself. I am pretty confident that the ones included above are just green plastic, with no laser rating whatsoever. If one is listed, I'd be willing to bet that it's utter BS.\n\nLong and short of it, if you're gonna save a buck on your laser engraver, don't skimp on the PPE to go along with it. Or you'll be giving yourself anti-lasik.\n\nFinal Edit: I'm also only considering the harmful potential of the unshielded laser module. This is ignoring the carcinogen laden fumes it's outputting. There is a reason laser cutters are enclosed both behind laser shielded material AND have their own filtration and extraction systems. This could also very easily start a fire if you're not watching it like a hawk, and even if you are, I can see a mosquito fart knocking it over, or it overshooting the material it's engraving and scorching the surface beneath it. \n\nAs much as I want a laser cutter, this seems like a bad idea. 3d printers and CNC routers are one thing to downsize and lose all the safety gear. The damage they can do is pretty limited to localized burns and possibly losing a digit to a router bit. Laser cutters are next level dangerous.",
