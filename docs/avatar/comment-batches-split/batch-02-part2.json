I am worried about making the same mistake. The poly looked horrible, i think we used a minwax Oil based poly, on top of my Kona Gel stain .. .I think we did the same thing with the stain i didnt let it sit long enough and wiped to much off. it looked nice in the begging but the next day it was faded quit a bit. But it wasn't that bad., WE covered it with some poly and it was horrible looking made it look faded even more??? no idea why? I put down a the butcher block oil on the butcher block before staining not a oil based pre stain. I have no idea but i am looking for idea on what to cover my stain with, i do NOT LIKE POLY at all. It was so plastic looking and showed so much flaws along with looking cloudy. .",

Ya i know, its chinese, its unsafe, etc, etc..... you dont have to be a rocket scientist with these....i bought one on amazon, did a tweek here and there. I use inkscape (free)....and scorchworks (free) to use this K40 laser, and it works great....dont have to deal with chinese software.... you learn alot, the cost is super minumum.... if you dont like it, or you get bored with it, sell it on craigslist for  $200....lesson learned.\nsooooo. to wrap things up.....Couple years ago, i built my own. bigger and better c02 laser and still using free software. Cost me $1500 to make, and i have more than made up the cost to make it.....life treating me fine right now....retired. Learned off the K40, reading reviews, watching you-tube videos......then make your own.....cant tell you how many people have made their own.....a ton.",

I wouldn't put boss anywhere near epilog. \nFor general use CO2 lasers I would do a list like this:\n- K40 + upgrades\n- 50W ebay/ali chinese\n- 80W ebay/ai chinese\n- All in ones or what you call kickstarter lasers (including the more expensive dremel brand one)\n- Branded chinese lasers with local support (boss, thunder, aeon etc)\n- Finally top tier RF lasers (epilog, trotec, ULS etc)\nThere's plenty of specific machines that fall outside those categories. Like aeon having an 'all in one' style series and thunder laser having RF source lasers.",

I use it for plans to accompany my videos and for client pitches to give everyone a clear understanding of exactly what will be produced. Now that I’m somewhat proficient in sketchup, of course, they make the announcement that it will no longer be free in the near future, so it seems like Fusion will be the way to go. I’ve heard a few folks plugging your new 360 course and since folks who get my plans won’t even be able to view the models for free, it’s looking like I’ll be making the switch in the near future.",
