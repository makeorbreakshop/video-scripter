Called F.S. and got nothing. They had stopped making the main control board and offered NO assistance. Bought a new power supply and Main processor from Light Object and got machine back up and running. Quite different software to learn, but, now I prefer it. I CAN'T recommend F.S. for their customer service or warranty. Just had to replace an axis driver. Another $50 gone! Please do your OWN research!",

Most stamps require about 1 to 1.5mm of depth in cutting to differentiate the printable area from the not printable. I saw your review of the Ortur, and I can get one with a little more powerful laser. (20W instead of the 15W, which as you pointed out is really like 6 watts vs. 4 watts) Do you think that will do the job? Thank so much!",
