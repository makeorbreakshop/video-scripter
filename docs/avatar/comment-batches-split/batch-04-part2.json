For cutting thicker materials it also gets in the way because there's only a 2mm gap at optimal surface focus.\n\nI made a temporary enclosure out of cardboard and piped in a 170cfm (advertised flow) exhaust blower. It's not ideal or the safest enclosure material, but I never leave the laser unattended when in operation and have a small ABC extinguisher nearby. The blower is marginal for extracting the smoke, but that's likely due to the \"enclosure\" having an open front.\n\n\nMine is good to etch at faster than 9000, but at those speeds I haven't tested the accuracy. For slate coasters, it will even produce a textured surface at medium speeds.",

I have a question for you, I recently bought the Atomstack a5 pro and I noticed the x axis where the laser module mounts there is play in it where it rolls on the rail, not sure if I'm describing this right but simply put is the suppose to be play in that? It can rock back and forth but the few tests that I've done it doesn't seem to be rocking, just smoothly rolling on the rail.  You're my go to laser guru.
