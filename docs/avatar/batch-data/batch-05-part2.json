They only sell the LU2-4 LF by itself.\n\nIt would be nice if they sold the machine with the option to get all three modules with it, which is what I want. As of now I would have to choose between LU2-2 or LU2-2 SF and then buy the LU2-4 LF by itself.

Second, Meerk4t will allow a lot more flexibility to your laser power, I think it does fast switching rather than varying the power.. It's not in Lightburn territory but it's way better than Whisperer and it's free.\nThird, the fan is upgraded, most now come with a perfectly adequate fan, rather than that dire fan on earlier models. Remove the internal ducting and you have really good extraction.\nThis means that you will only be spending around $100 for air assist and mirrors to get a very workable machine that competes with the Glowforge on most jobs.",

You wave and flail things you are holding as if we should look at them, but we can't. Check when you \"show\" the piece of basswood. You would not flip and wave it in the face of a friend would you? Part of this is also the wild arm wavings and gesticulations like you are doing a rap concert. I bet you do not do that in person either, or maybe people just stand well back to avoid injury. This breaks the personal experience of the video and gives some \"This Old House\" vibe (meaning poorly scripted, over acted). Basically you act like you are speaking to an audience, but you are not. On YouTube you are speaking one-on-one. Just my 2 cents. Keep up the good work.",

    "text": "Good info, thanks. I built my own laser cutter/engraver using a 15W (optical power) diode laser. The gantry is made using 3D printed parts and 2040 aluminum extrusions. Will need to install an air assist system to improve deep cuts. The only thing missed in this video is discussing how some sellers of diode lasers mislead buyers by specifying the power used by the diode rather than it's actual optical (cutting/engraving) power. As an example, I have another diode laser that is sold as a \"15W\" laser but actually puts out around 4.5 watts of cutting/engraving power. 15 watts is the amount of power it requires from a power supply.",
