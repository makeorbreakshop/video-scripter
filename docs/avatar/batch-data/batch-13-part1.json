    "comment_text": "Interesting video, thanks for sharing your thoughts on lasers. I'm very surprised you picked Glowforge above all other desktop lasers. \n\nHaving used both the Glowforge and others, the only benefit to Glowforge is ease of getting started.  The native Glowforge software is a bit easier to use, but it is also feature poor. They also hobble the software unless you pay a monthly subscription fee. \n\nOther drawbacks include - cleaning the Glowforge is more difficult, and the laser is underpowered for the price. Most importantly, and most hidden from the customer, - their support is weak at best; they are slow to respond to issues, if they ever do; and they don't really sell key replacement parts for wear and tear, instead they want you to ship your machine back and purchase a refurbished device for all but the smallest issues. \n\nOh, and  you have to upload your designs to their cloud based service, meaning you can't print if your internet is offline and they can monitor what you print on your machine.",

I watched the reviews on the muse, and some others. Basically I have narrowed it down to this X tool and the muse. I know the price difference is huge.\n\nIt looks like the X tool has a better rotary attachment. But the muse is obviously a little higher quality. I would just be starting out would you suggest a diode or CO2? Specifically one of these two machines. I guess the main thing that these would be used for is designs on leather and tumblers/cups. Any advice would be Appreciated. Thanks advance.",

I am a complete newbie and just looking looking for a retirement project/hobby business use. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\nShaun",

It appears that at the moment the 2S has been replaced by the 3Max but has the same laser equipment, or am I wrong?  Also, just an idea on review: in the RC community there are a lot of people that build their own aircraft from scratch (Balsa and plywood 3mm) and need to cut the wood with precision.  Which machine would you recommend or such a job?  knowing that the CO2 lasers are deemed a bit too expensive and too small for that use.  My idea was to look at the Neje 3 max as it has a nice big surface to work with but the question remains about how much power do you really need? is it the 5,5 or 6, 10 or even the 12W version.  If possible I would like to get you take on this?  Again thanks for all your reviews!!",

    "comment_text": "After messing around with the 3018 cnc machines for a few years I feel the Snapmaker would just be a disappointment, at that price I think you could buy a good laser, router and 3d printer but that 4th axis is a difficult one to cover..  I have a Millright Mega V XXL that came with a 4th axis and for $2300 you can buy the Mega V with a 4th and mill Aluminium..\nThe Snapmaker is an intresting machine but I feel that bed is just letting it down",
