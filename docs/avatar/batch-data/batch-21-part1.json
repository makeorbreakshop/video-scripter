Not ONLY is it removable, but it changes its placement, so that your auto-focus/focal distance doesn't change. \n\nFor $700, you're MUCH better off buying the Thunder, specifically due to their history and customer service. I wouldn't trust a brand new no-name company with that chunk of money or support, as things with these lasers can definitely go wrong/need replacement parts.\n\nWhy buy from a company thats trying to trim/cheapen the item, when you can literally buy from their supplier? Its like buying a knockoff.",

If you open the image to be printed in Photoshop and convert it to CMYK and save one copy with only the K channel as grayscale and the other as CMYK but leaving the black channel empty, then you print the color first and then the black one, you will have a real CMYK print. And on the other hand, there are cheaper compatible cartridges for the HP 62 cartridges.\nIt would be a good video to make.",
