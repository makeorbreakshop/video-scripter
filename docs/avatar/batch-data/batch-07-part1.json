    "text": "I have just purchased one of these machines and I can't get the laser beam in the tube to show or switch on. Water flow using supplied pump and distilled water are fine, although the rubber tubing supplied is crap and folds readily, with a series of clothes pegs, I have been able to press it open along full length providing no restriction to water flow. Power switches on and off to the machine okay, emergency stop working fine, temperature LCDs and Power LED working fine, as are the adjustment buttons. No damage to the box it came in or obvious damage inside, laser tube is watertight ie no cracks visible and no leakage. Set laser power to 30% following instructions in the instruction manual for mirror alignment on mirror 1, set masking tape across mirror  1 and pressed the pulse button. Result - no laser beam, and no burn on the centre of masking tape. Tried beam switched on constant, still no purple laser beam in the tube (as appears at time point 1.20 on the video) or burn on paper. I have tried increasing and decreasing power and temperatures in the tube have remained about 28 degrees C.\nMy machine does not appear to have a flow switch, having pulled the tubes both ways in the casing to their full possible extent. Is there anything else I need to do or can try other than sending it back to the supplier for a refund?",

    "text": "I didnt hear much about the speed of the glow forge in your review.  Personally, I think it is painfully slow. when I first started looking for a laser, I saw reviews just like this, and got all fired up and excited.  however, after digging deeper, checking out the specs, comparing this to others on the market, and then factoring in the total lack of actual support ( other than the community forums ), having to return the unit to even replace a tube, and for almost every other things, at. great cost - I soon realised, this was actually not a great machine for the money they are demanding for it.  It looks very nice, but, it just doesn't command the price.  \n\nthey do an excellent job of marketing, an immense job, but they they would ( in my opinion ) provide a much better product, with support if they pent less on the advertising and more into the product itself.  Once I made an initial enquiry, I was almost hounded by e-mail after e-mail after e-mail.  however when I replied with questions, their answers were always very vague, or often they would deviate from my question, paying lip service to it only, and trying to big up everything else in an attempt to negate my concerns, and convince me that despite my concern, there were so many other aspects that were simply amazing...anyway... hard pass for me im afraid\n\nI love your reviews in general, but I do have to say, I think this one was probably biased as a result of glow forge sending you the laser and air purifier etc..I know you said it wasn't, but it did sound like it.",

I personally believe it to be better all around then the software you use with the Glowforge. IF the Glowforge used lightburn, I'd save my money and buy one, but lightburn is the tool that tells me it's totally worth buying and upgrading the most expensive chinese laser you/I can afford.  50 or 60 watt IMHO !

Got Lightburn when I had the Ortur and was a simple process to upgrade the license to work with the Ruida controller on the 60w machine.  Makes for an amazingly capable machine with plenty of power for my current goals.\n\nI don't think there's anyway I'd be satisfied with a Glowforge.  Proprietary software, internet connection required, and could become a brick any day if the company ever shut down.\n\nNote: Ortur machine sold on Facebook Marketplace within 24 hours for about what I paid for it (of course I included all my upgrades so it was certainly more valuable than stock).",

    "text": "The reviewed equipment adds up to basically $7000. A quick look at OMTech shows you can get 100w, 24x40 (and passthrough), autofocus, a much deeper maximum depth (tumbler engraving anyone?), an actual chiller, two different styles of rotary machines, Corel graphics suite, and Lightburn for $6360. You'll have $640 left to spend on a camera for Lightburn so you'll have the same functionality as SlowForge. You'll also have a much bigger machine with more than twice the power and the ability to fix small things like laser alignment (good luck re-aligning your shiny new Glowforge if it gets bumped during shipping). The only thing you'll be missing is the air purifier and there are plenty of cost effective options out there.\n\nGlowforge shouldn't be compared to a cheap k40; it should be compared to what else you can get for the cost. For the cost, there are much better options.\n\nBtw, their $3000 basic machine gets equally spanked by a 50w OMTech. They do have great advertising though and the entire laser community has benefitted from it.",

    "text": "Personally for the cost, I would rather a 50w and lightburn, sure you will need a chiller and a bigger extractor, but the inability to be able to use a rotary, or a decent thickness of wood and the low power, the hard to clean, the fact you cant repair anything on it your self... Give me a machine I can work on my self every day of the week. \n\nalso closed ecosysytem for software nope sorry thats where pain comes, give it a few years and when glowforge decide they don't want to support it any more tough! (See Cricut for example of this happening) \n\nHaving a sealed path is a terrible idea in my view, replacing mirrors will be needed in the future and I bet that's a return to glow forge for them to do it and if its not then it will be an expensive option .\n\nA few questions, \n1) How long is the laser tube? cos it doesnt look like a real 40W have they done the trick of saying its peak and using that as a selling point, it looks (to me at least) more like a 35w tube. \n2) What's the fluid used for the cooling? does it have a decent amount of fluid in it? considering the size of most chillers they are bigger than the whole machine so what is it using? \n3) What's the max cutting and engraving speed? \n4) How easy to replace the lens? and how expensive? \n\n\nMy personal opinion is they are over priced and they also could do with someone understanding lasers doing the marketing (its not a printer for example) and to be honest they have a really bad reputation for going wrong due to things like ribbon cables, I guess they are the apple of the laser world, more expensive than a better option and a closed ecosystem .... \n\nNot for me but others might enjoy it.",

I've had some of the ribbon cables go bad and I wouldn't have made the lid work off a ribbon cable as well. When the lid cable went bad, the unit was useless which IMO is unacceptable.
