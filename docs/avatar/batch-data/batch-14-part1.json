    "comment_text": "Good and informative review. Thank you! Just one question.. With CO2-lasers the air assist near or on the nossle is for clearing the smoke and fumes, so the beam is unobstructed for a sharper, better result and the focusing lens gets less wear due to particles sticking to it and burning in. In the video you mention air assist, or lack thereof, on diode lasers, but as a lacking safety feature for putting out fires.. Is the use of air assis that different in the two types? In my experience the air assist can promote the opposite, as it fans any fire, adding more oxygen.",
