Any recommendations on which one I should get? And for a second machine would it be best to get a xTool F1 Ultra or an Apparel Printer that does Print To Bake? which do you think would give me a better spread to cover more ground? and any suggestions on one? I am very new to the field, watching your videos and motivated to get my feet wet and start working hard! I appreciate any advice you can give me. Thank you.",

You can buy UV ink in 1kg bottles if you own a regular UV printer... the inks expire quite fast, and you have to constantly clean/cycle the printer. If you think your dead inkjet printheads were bad, UV is infinitely worse and requires a lot of maintenance. I can definitely see people with dried up print heads if they just do this for fun once in a while. \n\nThat said, this is a really interesting and unique take on a UV printer but just the ink cartridges is an instant no for me. Bad to say, but I really hope someone else takes this idea and makes a ink tank version that works with regular UV ink on the market. lol.",

The importer on record for the parcel is the one paying the tariffs unless the exporter precollects it and then pays customs. So it could mean that Eufy pays the tariff or it could mean that Eufy is not collecting the tariff, and it's your problem when it arrives.",

    "comment_text": "🙋‍♂️ Warranty’s don’t cover everything. This machine has proprietary parts like a Glowforge, so when it breaks, you’ll likely have to pay to ship it to China for repairs, covering shipping and tariffs both ways, which could get pricey fast. The ink is already overpriced at $299 for 600ml, and with tariffs, it jumps to $477 to ship to you—that’s $12.50–$23.50 for just 100 small prints, compared to the 3060UV-V2’s $0.13 (one of many uv desktops) eufyMake’s lack of transparency on ink usage and support is a red flag, and they’ve already abandoned their 3D printer backers in the past, leaving them with nothing. They’re promising free shipping on 6,437 units, but that’s $7.9 million in shipping and tariffs they might not handle. If they do, this risks delays or hidden fees. You’ll also have to raise your prices much higher than expected to recoup costs on this toss-away machine. Also, could you please provide precise ml/print data for different print types (e.g., small prints, 3D textures, A4 prints) to help us calculate true costs Also, are there plans to ship from the United States for us to avoid tariffs? Or is this printer going to collect dust from customers that can’t afford the now higher cost for the ink?",

Where the cost is $22 in ink, and 7 hours to print. And when so many people buy these UV printers, the market will be flooded with people selling raised prints. The tumbler and mug markets are already saturated with sublimated items. The flat metal market, and sticker market the same. With heat transfers, sublimation, vinyl, direct to film (dtf), white toner laser, and other uv printers, the market is saturated with sellers using these technologies. This printer looks so cool, but that's also its problem ... when tons of people buy them, the market will be oversupplied with sellers. That's not a market I want in on. Etsy and eBay will be flooded with AI, raised/textured prints within days. And it will be a race to the bottom.\nI have been turned off by so many other youtube channels that seem to be just shills for this printer.\nThank you for pointing out some of the cons, and holding off your review until you get a production unit.",

The shipper called me and said it would be here Tuesday and they would call 30 minutes out.  Well, my wife was home all day because she is a kept woman 😜but they never called and just dropped it in the driveway… My wife called and said your laser is here but I can’t move it! lol So delivery is not the best. It sat in my driveway until I got home. Just know, no porch pirate is going to snatch it off your property.  It weighs 179 pounds! This is not your parents’ xTool  Laser!! It is a quality built Professional engraver. I am using the included exhaust system and it works pretty good. But I may upgrade it in the future. My xTool D1 20 is a great machine but it did not come with an enclosure or vent system. Is it fast? Yes. Yes! Can you get a darker image than he did? Yes. If you are just a hobbyist I would stick with the xTool brand. They are the best bang for the buck. But if you are a semi-pro or are looking for a side gig this machine is a no brainer. Just make sure your cousin Eddie is around to help you get it up on your work bench because my little 5 foot wife was useless when it came to that!",

    "comment_text": "Nah... most of us that are deep into printing, know that there's only a handful of chemical ink producers, and it's no longer the 90s, and basically everyone follows very similar formulas and pigment densities. UV ink is only special in it's resin binder that's activated by very specific wavelength of UV light. The most common is 395um. But even still many commercial UV inks will cure within a range of 385um to 405um.\n\nThat being said... if I bought this printer, the first thing I would do is learn the cartridge system, and see if they are chip coding them or not. And secondly, if there was a way to non-destructively refill them. BECAUSE, even really good 3rd party UV ink should only cost you between $15-20 per liter. There might be some variance on the white, it's particle size and what specific inkjet heads they are using. Again, this is a start-up, so I promise you they aren't designing their own piezo electric print heads from scratch. They are sourcing them from Ricoh or Epson. If you know which one, you can buy inks specifically tailored to that particular print head. It's not that complicated.\n\nRemember, ALL printer companies make their business model around you, the customer always buying ink from them, keeping them in business.",

    "comment_text": "It's cool but it has things putting me off totally aside from the cost of ink (which as you say isn't too bad when you consider it per item):\nif its not popular enough and they stop selling it you won't be able to buy the ink because it has, by the sounds of it,  electronics preventing 3rd party inks (and would 3rd parties even bother making it for a niche/unsupported printer)\n3 levels of software subscription (!)\nFinally it sounds like it will be annoying in the same way an inkjet printer is - in that if not used for a couple of days it will spend minutes whirring, clacking and wasting very expensive ink and cleaner to clean it's heads.",

Gengar is mostly purple adding in the eyes and and teeth using the Eufymake would be insane. Please give it a try. Or you could take like a 3D Printed car or something and add a logo or something that runs the length of the car. I know these are Random examples but when i see a new gadget i think of how it can enhance or make up for the shortfalls of other gadgets. Thanks for your break down it really got me hyped for this machine.",
