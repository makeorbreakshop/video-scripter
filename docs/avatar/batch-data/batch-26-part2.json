Would you be willing to make a video talking about the peos and cons of each unit, as you see them?\n\nI \"backed\" them and opted for the Ultra. I didn't just do it because \"higher number = better\" but because the Ultra has the MOPA fiber laser, and that's something I *think* I want...\n\nI mean, I like having more settings to play with and I think the colors that can be put onto stainless steel and titanium look pretty cool, both things that having MOPA enables, but I haven't used either type of fiber laser so maybe I'd change my mind if I had more information... For instance, if the colors aren't *that* great in real life, maybe the extra cost won't be as valuable to me any longer.",

I don't know how to describe it but basically an( x-y) bed that can be tiled to create a more generous work area. the bed of the machine seems large in comparison to the work area (?100mm) Even if it was only in one linear direction that would be a plus- just like the gantry machines move the laser head the table could move instead.",

They do have some parts but it's very normal for them to go out of stock for months with 0 way to backorder. Anker also abandoned their slicer software and mobile app years ago. It was left in a pretty buggy state. They have also outsourced a lot of their support to members of their discord community and have almost no official interaction with customers there. Community members have had to build custom print profiles for orca because the default profiles were extremely poor and resulted in repeated print failures. There also have been multiple reports of customers returning defective printers under warranty and being sent back a barely functional refurbished unit with major problems. I am confident this product works well and based on what I see there's nothing else on the market similarly priced. Just keep in mind anker support is awful and they do not have any loyalty to you as a customer. They will abandon you the second this product appears to be a commercial failure.",

Just place the bottom piece first to get the right spot for engraving, lift up the machine on anything steady hard wood or so on and done. figure out the right height for being able to do the cutting properly and you're set. depending on the laser only if it is still strong enough to cut out properly.

Bambus new H2D 3D printer has a laser head you can add which surprised me.   I did not get it because I have an Xtools F1 and Onelaser but also why would I want all that dirt and smoke on my 3-D prints? But anyway other companies had better step up in the prosumer space because if they get serious and come out with a lidar, 5 camera, AI controlled big boy I would bet small companies will be out of business within a few years.

And the of the biggest issues are with the print head and ink.\n\n- Ink tends to dry out and clog. Any news on how thos is handled with the resin? I known it's UV resin and doesn't exactly dry out. But over time, it can still happen. Colored resin isn't just resin. There's still ink particles that can clump up when sitting idle.\n\n- The print head is easily the most annoying component. They shift and rare out over time. They're not easy nor cheap to replace. And it's not like we can just call a repair shop to come over and fix this one.\n\n- I've ran into far too many issues with the ink spilling all over the printhead and down onto the paper and internal components. How would that be addressed with this printer? Resin would be a lot more difficult to remove than traditional liquid or powder ink.\n\n- To add to that, how easy is it to repair/place the print bed components? The belt, the gears, etc?",

    "comment_text": "If my limited knowledge about lasers is correct, the lower the wattage the smaller the laser point and the better for small engraving. I saw the demo on the 3D example and the steps. My question is this. With higher wattages on the Accalaser, will it be able to do smaller and more precise engraving? I'm wondering if the higher wattage are adjustable to your needs. I know power and speed go together, but you also want a precise and fine laser point when engraving smaller items. Just a point of view.",

Meaning, you must constantly be banging out prints or you eat up cleaning cartridges for simply sitting idle. I'm on edge about buying this machine because everyone talking good about it got it for free sponsored, and isn't exactly giving a truly bias opinion. Eufymake also dumped on their customers in the past launching products then killing support and dropping the product line all together. The only hope I have is that adam savage from tested used this so I'd hope it would mean it would be continuously used. If the self cleaning cartridges were cheap then not much of an issue. If some other china company sells cheaper inks, great, many headaches cost wise solved.",
