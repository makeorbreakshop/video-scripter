Just a quick question if I may - between the S9, S30 Pro Max and the S30 Ultra which one would be a better pick considering that the budget is somewhat flexible? It is for some general purpose cutting ( Balsa, Plywood, Acrylic etc. ) and less of engraving. I am somewhat inclined towards the S30 Pro Max with the 20W Laser Module.",

    "comment_text": "I've watched other comparisons where actual cutting time was measured. Before fully understanding the logic used to control the laser, I was surprised to see that machines with 600 to 1,000 mm speeds could only produce parts at roughly the same run time as machines with a maximum speed of 300 to 400 mm. The reason is that the faster machines have to overshoot the work area when ramping up and slowing down.\n\nUltimately, the best choice of laser comes down to (1) the purpose you intend to use it for (cutting or fine engraving) and (2) how fast it can perform the required task.",

This doesn’t even account for how much AI generated images have completely swarmed other store platforms to the point that it’s hard to tell what is a real storefront or just another grift. \n\nBy all means prove me wrong, but the strategies that worked in 2017 from standstill are no longer effective today.

So what’s the deal? Are these good or are they garbage? Any input would be appreciated as spending a grand or so on any gear at the moment is a bit of an expense for me currently. I can’t afford to be throwing money away on a product that’s going to work for a week and then fail on me. So what’s the best machine for cutting/engraving leather even if it does cost like $1000-2000~ that won’t go and crap out on a guy?",

    "comment_text": "Thank you and Congratulations 🎉for your great videos. Cheers!\nSir, May I ask your opinion...\nNow that you have quite an experience with different laser machines and using them for your business, would it be wise for me to already buy the more relatively expensive machines (xtool) to start my cutting & engraving business?\n Or should I start with cheap ones and upgrade later on?\n Would this come more expensive in the long run buying these  cheap laser machine and upgrade to Xtool? \nShould I just master my skill sets with the cheaper machine and relearn the more expensive machine in the future? \nIf you were to start over, what would you do? \nI have a starting capital of $10k.\nWhat machines will you recommend? \nI'd like to learn from champagne glass engraving to large multilayer plywood art cutting like Mandala arts.\nBeing now a retiree, I have  all the time to focus and learn the trade.\nI would appreciate if you can help me decide.\nMany thanks,\nAlvin",
