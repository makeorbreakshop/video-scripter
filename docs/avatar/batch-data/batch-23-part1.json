Are you able to have multiple modules in at one time, or not switch out bases, specifically for printing/cutting sticker paper which is thinner than wood? The switching of modules and bases would throw off indexing for the job. I understand there is a framing function for alignment. How accurate is framing function, how long does it take, how does its alignment compare to cricut/cameo which uses registration marks for alignment? Curious if the machine could print/cut decals well with good alignment and repeatability.  Lots of questions, but appreciate the response -- thanks!",

    "comment_text": "I like XTOOL - I own myself a M1 and a F1. Both bought as an \"Early Adopter\" - and thats exactly what pisses me off ^^\nYou always had that feeling, that everonye else who buy later gets the better deal, because they sell things to early in the process. After a few weeks/months they came up with \"addons\" they should have been part of the machine from the start on. \n\nHoneycomb on the M1, the Extension for the M1, the rotary tool 2, after you recently bought der v1 that was not that long on the market, ...\n\nAnd shortly after you bought a machine, they release the next one and \"forget\" about the old one ... to this day there is no fucking posibility to use Lightburn with the M1 (just with the Laser, i know that the cutting will not work with Lightburn). With the build in camera you're fucked if it comes to Precision. That Fisheye Lense didn't give you a chance if you try to engrave precicley. So let me use coordinates instead for god sake ...\n\nWith these Earley Adopter Machines we have financed all the \"ultra\" machines. Fine. They could make also an Pen-Holder, Embossing-Tool or something for the M1 - but ... I understand, that they want to make money. \n\nBut in the future, i'll wait and think twice about any buying decision.",

    "comment_text": "PLEASE! PLEASE! DO NOT BUY - I have spent about $3000 with Xtool - I purchased the D1Pro and some other stuff almost a year ago and I have had nothing but issues. Trying to work with Customer Service is INSANITY! I also purchased the Infrared, and it has never worked. I was told by Xtool \"Regarding the problem of the infrared laser head, many customers will not be able to use it successfully due to improper operation.\" So even if you follow their instructions and use the samples they sent, you still maybe doing something wrong. What are you doing wrong?--- you don't know, and they don't either, so you end up with a $500 paper weight. I watched tons of Youtube reviews on the D1Pro and they all gave glowing reviews; so, I went with it. Unfortunately, I and many others have not had the same success with Xtool as indicated in the Youtube reviews. After so many issues I decided to invest in another laser and speaking to some of Xtool competitors I asked question in hope that I don't end up with $3000 paper weights. The most chilling thing discovered was they are aware of Xtool and the issues the customers face. I noticed that a lot of the issues I've had with Xtool out the gate without me asking any questions they spell out what the machine can and can't do, their customer service and support. One guy said their Support Agents respond with 4 to 9 minutes and they quickly resolve your issue because they understand many of their customer use it for business purposes. Better than the 24 to 72 hours waiting for Xtool to respond and two weeks later you are still no where close to a resolution. OH, and those that have State side support definitely let you know that.\r\n\r\n I really don't want anyone to encounter this; because when you are not a wealthy person $3000 is a huge investment for you. PLEASE when researching for purchase do more than watch YouTube videos; it could save you time, money and peace of mind. PLEASE be sure to ask about customer service\\support, warranty, replacement parts. A big one would be \"What issues are commonly encountered by customers and how do you work to resolve those issues? \r\n\r\nI saw a post on Facebook asking, \"Why are so many people selling their Xtool?\" I laughed because I was looking to see how easy it would be to sell it. RFLOL \r\n\r\nWhen you have a quality product it is GREAT! I really enjoy engraving, cutting and making things it is so therapeutic. DON\"T FORGET to be diligent in your research.",

So my question/s 1) Can a riser be installed like on the M1 for a rotary attachment. 2) Is there a pass through or is it limited to just one size. 3) what is the max working area? 4) Have you received any information about an IR module option. 5) Does this work through the XTool Creative Space Software and Lightburn 6) Which Filter is needed to run indoors, is it the same as the F1 or does it require the large 699.00 model. 7) what type of ink cartridge is used for the printing and what type of ink is used. 8) What modules come with the base product. 9) Will it work with the screen printer.  10) If no camera will it use the iPhone option like the S1 can do now because the teaser ad shows batch printing so curious how that works. Ok so lots of questions I know but trying to decide do I pass this up and just get the S1. I hate that neither have the camera yet they installed the camera on the M1. I sometimes wonder what they are thinking when designing these machines. For a few bucks more it would be a real game changer had they added it. It looks similar to the Glowforge Aura but that does have the camera and pass through, but no rotary.",

I know this almost a year old, but I hope you still get notifications about comments. What would you suggest for engraving leather and metal? I’m looking to offer custom engraving on handmade leather goods either directly or with metal plates that could be silver or gold even. Any suggestions would be appreciated.",

    "comment_text": "Great video. Personally I would leave out packaging cost because that can be put into your shipping price, that the customer pays. \n\nI would add in misc business costs as a % on top - rent, supplies, kitchen, cleaning, insurance, registrations, safety equipment etc.\n\nAs for laser time, i've found that it is unrealistic unless it is the ONLY factor in pricing a custom one off job. A lot of people online use laser time but if you're also factoring machine cost, maintenance and labour, then counting laser time is basically double charging (in terms of working out your costs). \n\nHowever it does work in figuring out how to price a custom jobs on the fly, where you aren't making the same kind of item hundreds of times.\n\nUltimately if you are making at least 3-4x the cost of materials then you're doing alright.",
