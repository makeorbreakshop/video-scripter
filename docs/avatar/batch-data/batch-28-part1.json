    "comment_text": "I put down my deposit so now I'm just waiting for the Kick to start.  I have a few questions, I'm hoping you can answer.  1) How long do the resin cartridges last, ie: how much can you print?  I know that is somewhat subjective, based on what you print, and how much of each color you use, but take your Mando print on wood.  How much resin did that take?  How many of those could you print with a single kit?  2) Since the printer has to lay down a white layer under anything that isn't being printed on a white surface, is the white tank bigger than the colors?  I think I saw somewhere that the ink kit would be around $300 to replace, and if you're going through that (and/or a cleaning kit) every few months, that has a pretty high cost of usage.  3) I saw another video about printing on tumblers and cups and it seemed to suggest that the machine was pretty picky about the sizes and shapes of tumblers it works with.  The ones you demo'd appear to be Eufy branded, so not just any old tumbler.  It loses a lot of flexibility if you can only print on their materials.  4) The sticker lamination set up looks like it might require some kind of transfer material, and I'm wondering if that is also proprietary.  I live in Alaska, so I'm really cautious about new tech with proprietary media / materials, because all too often companies don't ship to Alaska or treat it like a completely foreign country.  ($200 to ship a $99 thing - Xtool won't even ship replacement lenses or mirrors to Alaska).  Thanks in advance.",

I don’t even own a printer so I need something I can manage without getting too technical. I’m mostly/only interested in cutting transparent acrylic and I would prefer free/cheap software at least to begin with but I also need the tool to be as cheap as possible bc I tend to be hesitant to use stuff that’s to expensive bc I don’t wanna break it. At the same time cheap one needs to require like least maintenance what do I do 🫢",
