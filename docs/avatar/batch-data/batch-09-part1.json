The darkest areas are engraved the deepest and as the shades of gray get lighter, the laser engraves with less power creating a 3D effect. Is there any way to manipulate the map data to do this. I know it's kind of a tough question but I'm trying to get more into this. Thanks.",

I think it goes for $1500 (I bought the kickstarter so its obviously a diff price) and I recommend it when ease of use and safety is accounted for. Research your seller to make sure good customer service is available. I haven't had problems and I've used it for about 8 months regularly. I also never cut at 50% to help save my CO2 laser, but thats a personal pref. Never look directly at lasers, always get glasses but you still shouldn't look directly at it with glasses on either.  Also research what materials you are cutting because gases released can be harmful if youre ignorant of what you're cutting. Hope this helps and glhf :)",

Couple things is this is my VERY first project in fusion 360, so it took me a long time to get everything dialed following your steps. I appreciate the thorough-ness of everything. Few daunting parts about \"you'll have to get all this dialed yourself\" when I know nothing about the program is a little intimidating, but I just followed your lead and am about to go try and cut this thing. Also side note, I took a screen shot of fusion 360, threw it in illustrator and just did a trace draw and deleted the paths inside, and it did seem to go a little quicker (Even though I lost my scale tool bar and couldn't figure out how to bring it back up) but also was way more precise on the edges (or so it seems, will let you know after the cut).

They pretty much all look like the same machines to me other than different paint schemes between them or I think the Ridge way had leuvers I think lol, if you had any suggestions on this I would definitely appreciate it!",

In other words, is there anything that needs to be configured before running the machine, so that the laser head does not collide with the machine's Frames? Thanks",

I would love to see how a MOPA or fiber laser would mark on the back of aluminum prints, and whether it would generate too much heat that would damage the image or coating on the reverse side. If you are willing to test it and make a video, I would be glad to send you some defective metal prints to practice on.",

My engraving business (operational for 13 years) took three years of 18-hours a day, 7 days a week to develop and become profitable - now serving corporate customers in 22 countries around the world. To infer that simply learning to laser engrave translates into a profitable business is disingenuous. It took me a couple of days to learn to engrave - and nearly 4 years before I saw a meaningful profit.\nViewers need to know that making a kitschy trinket does not necessarily translate into a profitable business...",

    "text": "You should differentiate the laser beam generation (fiber, disk, CO2, diode) and the beam steering (galvo, gantry) since they are different things and are not to be confused. Otherwise people will think a galvo can be only uses with fiber lasers which is wrong.\nIt's probably more feasible to use this combination, since fiber lasers usually have a better beam quality than diode lasers (up to 1/100, with one beeing the best and going to inf) and 1/10th the wavelength of CO2. Both increase the ability to focus the beam.",
