I can place it on any flat surface and engrave whatever I want. With that said, the F1 is still my overall favorite due to my own personal use case, but the D1 Pro is versatile... it has the room underneath for me to insert a full length baseball bat and use the rotary tool to engrave it. That wont fit on my others!",

Many other cheaper diode lasers have auto leveling via stepper motor and height detection DURING engraving, and don‚Äôt rely on a roller in a specific location.\n\n3.)

There is no offline anything with the m5c which is a joke.The app is completely useless and the files on the app are very few and arent all stl files so you cant directly print 90 percent of those files.. The slicer will tell you 10 hour print and turn into 15 hour print somehow while printing. The fact that the company's on website lies about its own features should be enough to scare anyone away from buying this. And for the price, you can get many different 3d printers that utilize more types of filaments and have some sort of upgrade so your printer can do all the things you want with 10x better slicer. And the m5 is an even bigger joke with a camera that does nothing... I wouldnt recommend this to any entry-level person either because that's just predatory to suggest a bad product to someone who doesn't know any better.",

    "comment_text": "I have owned several lasers over time. From my first Laser Master 2, to the Xtool S1 and P2. I wish I had known about the survey, I would have contributed. I actually sold my P2 because it was just way too cumbersome. The Xtool machines are a good bang for your buck, but there are two things I absolutely HATE about them. 1st, the hose size for the exhaust tubing is 3 inch. This means it won't fit most standard duct tubing which is 4 inches or more. I had to print adapters for the S1 and P2. There is no good reason for them not to use the most common size. Though I guess this could be some attempt at proprietary BS so that you have to buy tubing and exhaust accessories from them. 2nd, the implementation of lightburn compatibility is terrible. It's janky as all hell and badly thought out. Plus the camera functions of the P2 never worked in lightburn for me. If I could do it again, I would go with a company like Thunder Laser. They are also Chinese, but they have USA based support and sales people. So my issues are never brushed aside and the BS claims are less.",

I have used quite a few different software programs to accomplish my goals. I used QGIS for when I needed buildings, Snazzy Maps for streets, roads and highways, finally Open Street Map for a little bit of both. Snazzy is the easiest but you can‚Äôt export SVG files for editing, nor does it do buildings at the resolution I need. QGIS and Open Street Map both do buildings but have Steeper leaning curves with multiple steps and that slows down my workflow. I would love to offer custom maps, but the time it takes me to design one map, to sell that one map, makes it a poor financial decision (time is money). I have other products that are far easier to make, and therefore more profitable. If Laser Map Maker is easier to use and can draw up buildings and exports SVG files, then I can make custom maps faster and make more money, then it is a good deal to me.",

    "comment_text": "This is unprecedented in my view.  I've waited years for someone to do this with a stabilizing system.  I didn't even know the 360 pan from a Youtube vid screen was even possible.  I was just happy to have a stable view.  The only thing I have to nit pick about was that payload that kep careening into the field of view.  Also, wasn't it kind of dangerous to fly in occupied air space?  I thought the routes were always cleared through permitting.  Outstanding new take on the whole weather balloon adventure.",

You need to click \"download\", which is a bit confusing indeed.\nThen to actually generate G-code, I use the slicer of my Bambu printer, which has presets and is probably more tailored to my printer than Fusion360 is, I assume.\nGreat video though !",

Mine has issues and they send me parts to fix it myself. This will shut your business down during the months it takes to get it back.  If you have critical failure they will replace once you send yours back and get the replacement.  This will take several more months.  They will let you give them $2500.00 refundable deposit if you have a spare $2500.00 to give them for several months.",
