My son in-law just purchased an OMTech 80Watt laser for about\nthe same cost of the Glowforge Pro, he can use Lightburn and then have complete control over his designs as well as still being able to run his laser even if Lightburn\ngoes out of business.",

Cost seems massively higher than it needs to be, I would rather the 3 or 4 otur master Pros you can get for the same price.\n\nThe combined diode sounds cool though but it's not the equivalent of a co2 due to the frequency of the light, need mentioned cutting optically clear items but you can't do that with a blue light diode....",

Because of the power and speed of diodes, they will stay in the hobby segment for most people and the price tag is probably to steep for most people to take this machine into consideration.

    "comment_text": "Hi Brandon, I have to say, you are the only person that I watch when it comes to laser talk. Though I know nothing of the machines and most of what you speak of is a foreign language to me, I enjoy watching them all the same. With that being said,  I am seriously in need of suggestions because I have absolutely no idea what I need to purchase, especially since I have never laid eyes on a laser/engraver in my life.\r\nWhichever one I purchase will be going inside my craft room in my house. The room is 25 ft long X 13.5 wide so space is not an issue, however, the entrance to my house is only 34‚Äù wide, so it would have to be small enough to go through the entrance.\r\nIn no particular order, these are the things that I would love to learn to create‚Ä¶ Jewelry pieces (namely earrings) from wood, leather, and acrylic. I‚Äôd like to be able to cut out the wood to assemble jewelry boxes, shadow boxes, keepsake boxes, small-medium-sized desk organizers, and similar items. I would also like to be able to learn how to make round door signs (at least 15‚Äù), 3D layered designs and other wall decorative items.\r\nI would love to be able to learn how to engrave on leather and acrylic, books, personalize journals, wallets, and a few other items. I am not new to crafting, just new to laser cutting/engraving.\r\nI would greatly appreciate all suggestions that could help me make my final decision as well as any other equipment that could help make things run smoother and of course, the more budget-friendly it is, the better.",

You're the gold standard when it comes to laser reviews on youtube.\nI've been on the market for a laser for quite a while now and can't seem to make up my mind, so I really appreciate these vids.\nI know I want a dual diode laser. My 1st choice right now is atomstack x7 as they now are promising air assist to be released for it soon. Neje was on my radar, but their setup seems very \"janky\" and I've heard they're overdriving their diodes way too high = shorter lifespan.",

Considering these Chinese lasers are always 10w under the stated rating, you are ending up with 20w of cutting power. You might as well stick with a diode laser.",

I'm looking at a diode laser like this but I was wondering if you can speak to your experience in cutting wood materials like plywood, MDF, or solid wood. Thinking about this for making jigs and templates for routing. Do you know if this will cut up to 1/2 in materials? I wanted to use a laser for that and engraving cutting boards.",
