    "comment_text": "Xtool advertising is misleading. They say the P2 works with Lightburn (with exception of auto focus, cameras and curve feature). Given i already have a D1 and Lightburn works perfectly with it, I had no reason to assume Lightburn wouldn't work with the P2 with the exception of the explicitly stated limitations above.  I can understand not having the curve support, but all other functions should be available. Also, the XCS software is horrible. I would not expect it to be on par with LIghtburn, but there are a multitude of little things like being able to easily define layers or remove the close up view when not needed. All in all, unless you are happy to only work in XCS (assuming full support for Lightburn never comes), save your money and buy another brand CO2 (Monoport, Omtech) and get a fiber laser to go with it for what you pay for the P2. I am posting this comment not as a criticism of the this video, but in the hopes that someone watching this video in trying to decide whether to buy the P2 or not, are more fully informed. I did a fair amount of research before buying the P2 and everyone either intentionally or unknowingly failed to mention just how limited LIghtburn for P2 is nor just how bad the XCS software is.",

    "comment_text": "I think you are spot on in your analysis. You went back to 1928, but let’s go further back: We saw the same trends with new technologies like electricity, the steam engine (revolutionised the weaving industry), the wheel…. Each time, we have seen new jobs emerge as a result.\n\nFor woodworkers, we can be divided into two categories: Some are production focussed, churning out the same chairs, tables, coasters every day in as high a volume as possible. For them, automation will be a God-send as they will be able to produce more a day. The other category are the more “creative” (no offence, producers) that hardly ever make two identical products. Here, machines may replace certain steps, but not the entire creative and assembly process. It’s especially the creative work that AI cannot replace - at least for many years to come.",

When the beam had penetrated a millimeter into the material, one would need to lower the focus by that millimeter, but then some \"sideways\" rays that come at angle wouldn't reach deep into the groove and will hit the material around the groove instead. Heating and possibly graying them. Is there a place where I can find explanations on that matter?",
