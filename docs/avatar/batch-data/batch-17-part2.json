Not sure how good the IR head is because it’s dreadfully slow but it does allow me to mark on materials the blue diode can’t touch. Love the channel and thanks for the brilliant reviews and knowledge base.",

I recently bought an AF2028-60 from them. When it arrived it was instead a usb-0705-u1. Instead of the 600mm/s time of the machine advertised, it was  listed at 500mm/s. I contacted customer service and they said I got an upgraded model. But if so why is it slower. It seems more likely to me someone either screwed up or sent me an older model and thought I wouldn't notice. Any advice you've got would be appreciated. Love your channel by the way.",

    "comment_text": "Got my laser off eBay, 100W tube, 900x600 huge area, Autofocus, rotary axis, 900mm/s max speed in stock configuration. Paid $2000 delivered, earned probably $6000 with it already. All these machines that you test are just fancy toy machines for people who know nothing about technology really. Hardly upgradable too. That tiny area is probably barely going to cover needs of a housewife, and don't even get me started of how much these companies are charging hamsters for their K40 $300 equivalent toys. If I wanted to spend a $3000+ on a CO2 laser, I would just build a freaking servo driven 150W  1m2 monster. They way people waste money is just hilarious. I mean, same people buy carton sheds in usa for $500000, what can you expect from them after that lol. The only thing I truly hate about all industrial lasers is a very stupid controller and a software, RUIDA controllers absolutely suck and they are supposedly the best around, so everything else is even worse apparently. I'd love to have some opensource FW options to be able to tinker and add more features to industrial lasers.",

But. further on in their spec sheet they say it comes with a 12v 5 Amp power supply.... eye roll.... yes, that is a 60 watt power supply.... so I really don't know where they get 130W from.... Anyway, it is their spec, you are being true to what they give out.      On the co2 equivalent, the Epilog 75watt I had use of for a few years, required 240v and required a 15A circuit, so perhaps they should say it was a 3.6 Kilowatt machine.... I must say though, I am pretty impressed by these little laser machines, and they do some stuff better than a co2, just slower",

Not sure if that's a thing that is ever used with the cheaper lasers. Or, honestly, even the larger ones. I've never used a CO2 laser. I've found I get much better engraving results (or at least have to sand a lot less) if I don't use air for my engraving, or I use really minimal air. Really dig the channel and reviews. Thanks 🙂",

One thing I never see mentioned is diode laser life. My x20 has reduced in power by about a third (according to my cut tests) with only 10s of hours on it. It's not a dirty lens/lens protector or S30 setting issue. They have agreed for me to send it back (after copious amounts of poor and repetitive formulaic email support). On the whole I'm not impressed with the build quality. The focus adjustment is sloppy (the addon z-height adjuster requires moving the M2.5 tapped holes for a limit switch), my x-axis eccentric nut was over tightened at the factory which damaged the v-wheels and I had to replace them. The cable management is poor. My next laser is going to be the Roly 20 or 40W. The Roly10W build quality is amazing and their tech support is first class.",

    "comment_text": "Comparing diode laser to CO2 laser do you really run the 55 watt CO2 at 55watts or even 40 watts since that will really shorten the life of a very expensive-to-replace laser tube?  It seems like most folks are actually running their CO2 lasers at 40% or so output which puts a 20 watt diode much closer to a 55watt CO2.",

    "comment_text": "Hey man love your videos. Could you make a video on safety protocols? I watched your video on the omtech polar and purchased one. But after reading the manual, im super scared of random reflections from the laser bouncing out of the engraver. The manual says to always wear glasses, is it really necessary? I thought I would be able to look through the glass lid while the machine is engraving ... Do I only need glasses for this? What if I open up the tray and use the pass through, or the rotary tool, does the opening at the front of the laser leave me susceptible to laser reflections and  possible burns or blindness? I know it may seem like i'm being overly paranoid, but these are the things the warning labels talk about, yet I see people operate them online as if closing the lid is more than enough. I even saw one man stoop down and get eye level with the laser as it engraved a glass cup, the front of the engraver was exposed and open. I'm a complete novice and have no basis as to what is normal to do or not to do. I would truly appreciate your insight on this.",
