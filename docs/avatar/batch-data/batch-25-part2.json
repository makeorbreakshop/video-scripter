Since it is so small and the screen is packed with functions it is often hard to see  where the cursor is on the screen. I have worked with Camtasia in the past that would automatically zoom in at your cursor position which is even better. Camtasia is pretty expensive but I bet the cheaper options like OCB (free) will have similar functionality.",

You are getting a sub from me!\nI have been looking at getting a 3D printer, but had to put the purchase on pause due to another big purchase (an affordable house!) and then this bad boy dropped! My partner got excited and asked me if i would rather save up a little more money and then get this 2 in one, because i would like to try laser cutting but its not my main focus and the machines are rather expensive. \nSo here i am trying to research if the printer is worth it or not and from your review, which was sooo much more helpful since you know the details about laser cutting and most other reviewers are 3D printers, and i think i feel like this is a 100% the route i should go, i get to have the 3D printer i wanted but as an added bonus i can play around with the laser cutter function and it sounds like the quality and what you get is quite good even though the size is a trade off.\nBut i am also a hobbyist, i love trying my hand at many hobbies and i don't think i need a bigger surface to cut on to begin with, so honestly it really sounds like a great fit for someone like me, who needs the 3D printer but would love to try a laser cutter too :)",

Or maybe designs on their gaming consoles, or desktop gaming PC.  Etsy is full of stuff, and I wouldn't be surprised if someone already has a shop full of random offset UV printed projects.

Without the vent opening, this sealed machine will have no way for fresh air to get into the machine at a high enough volume to not starve the filter. It‚Äôs clever, as the vent is in the front top, while the exhaust is in the middle height at the rear. So this gives you an air flow that goes right through the shortest distance, which happens to be the area where the laser is working.\n\nIf the size of the bed is ok for people and you just don‚Äôt have the room, then this is fine. The quality seems to be pretty good. As far as the different time scales for the laser or the printer, well, you just have to manage your time. If you know what you‚Äôre going to be doing, then do the short job first. These things are a compromise. If you‚Äôre willing to accept that, then it‚Äôs great. If you can‚Äôt, then this isn‚Äôt the machine for you. But don‚Äôt forget this also cuts and draws. This might be useful and it may not.",
