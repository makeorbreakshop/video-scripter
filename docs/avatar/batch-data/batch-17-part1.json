I need to cut cardboard (not corrugated) thick ranging 0.5 mm - 5 mm ( that's max i think) and some wooden plywood (in some cases). Would you advice something with reasonable price (Say under 1 - 1.5K) ? I cannot justify spent 2k on device i use once a month or so.",

The factor that you didn't mention at all is likely the biggest factor to consider when making this decision... Serviceability.   While the K40 is obviously repairable, since it can be upgraded, it's my understanding that the Glowforge is not serviceable at all.  \n\nLast year I was considering buying a used Glowforge and found dozens for sale.  Thinking that anything bought used would likely at least need a new tube I looked into the cost of parts and the tube.  Turns out you can't buy parts or repair the machine on your own.  If your tube, or any other part, goes out then the only option is to ship the machine back to Glowforge and they will give you a discount on buying a new one.  I couldn't find any other service information so I opted to not get one.  \n\nIt's a truly  horrible policy that makes the Glowforge seem more like a scam than a ligament machine.  I hope that I either missed something or they fix the way they treat their customers.",

    "comment_text": "Good grief -- 40w -- good video, nice work as always -- I wish I had bought the X-tool.\n\nOrtur issues  info below:\n\nWell-Known Issues with Ortur Lasermaster 3: A Comprehensive Review\n\nIssue 1: Ortur LM-3 Not Powering On\nOne of the most prevalent problems encountered by users of the Ortur Laser Master 3 is its failure to power on. This issue can stem from various factors, including a faulty power adapter, blown fuse, loose connections, malfunctioning laser module, or motherboard glitches. Notably, the Ortur LM-3 has faced criticism for having an underpowered \"power brick.\" Despite seeking assistance for this issue, my attempts were met with silence. Subsequently, I discovered a suitable replacement on Amazon.\n\nIssue 2: Inadequate Laser Engraving\nWhen laser engravings fail to meet expectations, several causes might be at play. These include improper focus, uneven engraving area, or unsuitable materials for engraving.\n\nIssue 3: Mid-Operation Halts\nFrequent occurrences of the machine halting during operations can be attributed to loose connections, faulty motors, or software/firmware glitches. This issue has been highlighted extensively on YouTube.\n\nIssue 4: Subpar Engraving Quality\nSubstandard engraving quality can arise due to incorrect settings, a dirty lens, or a malfunctioning laser module. To rectify this, adjustments in settings, proper lens maintenance, and considering the laser module's condition are recommended.\n\nIssue 5: Smoke and Odor Production\nDuring operation, the machine emitting smoke or strong odors might be a result of a dirty lens, improper settings, or insufficient ventilation. This concern is commonplace among lasers, particularly during cutting. Installing proper external ventilation and employing an enclosed setup are advised solutions.\n\nIssue 6: Unusual Motor Noises\nMotors emitting abnormal sounds during operation may be attributed to loose connections, inadequate lubrication, or faulty motors. Similar observations have been shared on YouTube. A common cause was Ortur's inadequate tightening of drive sprocket set screws, resulting in loosening.\n\nIssue 7: SD Card Recognition Failure\nWhen the machine fails to recognize an SD card, possible reasons include a faulty SD card, corrupted files, or firmware complications. Contacting Ortur for assistance may lead to unresponsiveness, as evidenced by my own experience.\n\nIssue 8: Machine Freezing During Operation\nMachine freezing mid-operation may stem from software/firmware glitches, motherboard issues, or communication problems between the machine and the computer. Establishing a reliable link between my Ortur LM-3 and my computer proved to be a major struggle. Despite weeks of effort and assistance from Ortur, I ultimately sold my brand-new machine at a loss due to this issue.\n\nIssue 9: Inconsistent Engravings\nInconsistent engraving results might result from incorrect settings, a dirty lens, problematic materials, or a malfunctioning PWM (pulse width modulated) laser power controller. Obtaining assistance from Ortur for this issue was often challenging.\n\nLack of Customer Support and Service\nIn terms of customer service and support, Ortur falls significantly short. Despite purchasing their hardware, I received no aid when problems arose. Requests for help went unanswered, and defective parts were disregarded. Unfortunately, Ortur seems unwilling to invest in its customers' needs or satisfaction.\n\nPersonal Experience with Ortur LM-3\nMy excitement for the Ortur Laser Master 3's potential to enhance my workshop quickly turned to disappointment and frustration. Despite its promising appearance, I encountered only obstacles and minimal assistance from Ortur. Their lone response directed me elsewhere for help. Ultimately, after exhausting various resources without resolution, I was forced to sell the Ortur LM-3 at a substantial loss, leading to the demise of my aspirations.\n\nAn Urgent Recommendation\nGiven my ordeal, I strongly advise considering alternative options before investing in an Ortur product. It is my hope that you avoid supporting a company that displays such an evident lack of commitment to both product quality and \ncustomer service.\n\nParting Thoughts\nI am not inclined to write negative reviews, but I felt compelled to share my experience as a cautionary tale for others. Thank you for taking the time to read my account, and I sincerely wish you success in your pursuit of a laser product that truly meets your expectations.",

    "comment_text": "The problem that I have with Atomstack (and various other companies) is that they lie outrageously about their laser power, advertising the power consumption of the unit rather than the optical output power (which is the only thing that is meaningful). Reputable companies (J-Tech Photonics and Gweike Cloud, for example) do not do this. Yes, Atomstack buries an optical output power deep in their text, but I wouldn't trust it to be accurate given how dishonest they are in the rest of their advertising (for example, 48W for the X40 MAX is **obvious** BS to anyone familiar with diode lasers). In my opinion, we should boycott all laser manufacturers that even mention the power consumption, given how much it misleads many buyers. And, I want to see them show the ACTUAL laser output power being measured with a power meter (again, J-Tech and Gweike Cloud do this).",

I will be making a lot of stamps so I know a larger bed is one important factor and probably good ventilation is another. A lot of the machines don’t indicate use with rubber.  Should I assume if I don’t see rubber listed on the materials that I cannot use rubber in that machine?  Do you have any suggestions for a good model for what I’m trying to do?  I was thinking of the Omtech 40W O2 but that is kind of pricey for me just starting out.",
