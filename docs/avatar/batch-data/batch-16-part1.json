I just got the 20w machine for $699.\n\nAmazing you can get a 50w CO2 machine for less than that new xtool 40w diode machine. Still think it‚Äôs kind of bad they pulled the 40w D1 unit just to force upsells.",

They explain that it's due to keeping it a class 1 laser (but they've been known to powder the truth in the past).\n\nThe WeCreat machine you reviewed was created to be a competitor to M1, not S1, and yes, they are both meant for the crafter segment. Sadly xTool decided to pretty much abandon M1 users with no upgrades or new features since they released air assist and riser base over a year ago.",

The only benefit versus making a basic one yourself is the auto shutoff if you have kids running around or something, but that can also be added to a homemade enclosure also without much trouble. \nSeems a bit sus that xTool pulled the 40w D1. Seems like they're trying to push people into buying this new unit. It would also be nice if they offered the ability to step down the 40w laser to 20w for finer engraving like other laser diode makers are doing, but it seems like they're more interested in getting their customers to buy an entirely different laser module... another upsell. \nWhat would be nice is to see a comparison of this unit to your favorite budget CO2 laser. It feels like this is getting expensive enough that it would be easy to jump to a goob budget friendly CO2 instead.",

    "comment_text": "I find it crazy that people buy into the unshielded lasers expecting anything good to come of it. The only laser cutter/engraver I have experience with was a massive unit with full shielding and multiple warning stickers about the dangers of laser radiation. These unshielded units are either not powerful enough to do what they advertise, or they are dangerously leaking radiation into your surroundings and you should probably discontinue using it. Generally, a laser above 5mw is enough to cause eye damage if directly shone into your eyes, and lasers above around the 250mw range can cause temporary eye damage indirectly in large exposure. Above 500mw, the damage is permanant. \n\nThese units are often claiming their lasers are \"40W\", which is 80 times the limit for permanent eye damage. This makes the lasers about 9 times more dangerous to handle for the end user. At this level, indirectly viewing the beam or the landing point of the beam will damage your eyes, likely permanantly. The wave length of the laser doesn't change much about the danger to your eye sight, as even undetectable in the UV and IR wave lengths will blind you. Non-visable-light-based lasers (say that 5 times fast) are often more dangerous as you don't even have any reflexes to mitigate the damage. Visable light lasers will cause your eye to reflexively close, which limits the exposure time and chance of blindness. IR and UV wavelengths don't trigger this response, so you won't know anything is wrong until your eye starts hurting which means the exposure time is already exceeding three times the normal amount for visable light, if not more so. Don't cheap out on laser tech, it's dangerous.",

I build all my own golf clubs and want to start diving into engraving, hand stamping and paint fill. The hand stamping and paint are very easy. The engraving, after doing research, is much more difficult to find the right machine. Your feedback would be VERY helpful!",

Would really like to have a cabinet model 60w or 80w laser, but it's just not in the cards right now.  Are you still loving your K40, and how is it holding up?  Thanks for the video...",

It looked like you were using geenish (likely welding-based) protective glasses for a laser that's around 450nm..\nIf that's right, then ur a bit wrong..  and you want orangey ones..   It's not LPF / HPF ..  all the glasses are band-pass (or band-stop) filters.\nI recall finding tables online, it might be worth some reflection.",
