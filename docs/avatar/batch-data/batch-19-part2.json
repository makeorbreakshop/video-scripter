With diodes you can mask the material and it stops charring on the back of the item.  Is this needed on CO2 devices?  Do you also need to get the honeycomb to protect the materials?  If not this may be savings between the different operations of units.  For sure leaning towards the Gweiki..thanks",

    "comment_text": "I think there is a lot of nuance in getting the right laser cutter. The Polar looks like an interesting machine and I might be interested if I was getting something for my house. I'm a teacher and the Glowforge works best for my classroom. The footprint is just right for the classroom (looks similar to the Polar). The web interface is a selling point, allowing us to manage multiple users easily and not worry about software. I only use the interface to set up my cuts, where the camera is very useful. Everything else is done in Illustrator, Inkscape, or Vectornator. The subscription is completely optional and unnecessary. Respectfully, the review makes it sound almost required - that is simply incorrect. I have 5 Glowforges (the plus model). They are used constantly, the oldest being 3 years old, and I have never had a serious problem with any of them. Support was quick and helpful when an issue did present itself, the GF was cutting again by the end of the day. It is a no fuss machine - and that is what I need when working with 100 students each quarter. If I were buying a hobby machine I would have different requirements, but the Glowforge is pretty awesome for us. Just wanted to provide a different perspective/experience.",

The M1 spec states a 385x300mm (15x12 inch) working area, but is that the max size of the material sheet BEFORE cutting or just the max size of the cutting area?  For example, can I insert a sheet of 8mm MDF into the unit that is say 400x310mm and then design a shape to cut inside the 385x300 working area?  The reason I ask is that the shape I need to produce could be 300x300mm so it would be nice to be able to rough cut a slightly larger sheet to then make sure the finished shape can be cut out allowing for a small border.  Hope that makes sense?",

The second question is; when the lasers color mark on the stainless is it really laser annealing where the surface of the metal is not etched or is it true etching.  I need laser annealing because these stainless pieces will be used in hygienic applications where they need to be smooth and easy to clean.  Thank you!",

One of those being the RE3 software and machine now requires an Internet connection by default in order for you to use the software. after contacting Support several times I was finally given a key of sorts and URL to enter said key in order to force the software local so I did not have to have a Internet connection.
