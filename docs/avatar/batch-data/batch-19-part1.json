What are the replacement cost for the laser, airlifters etc.  I know we are comparing a diode to a Co2 but I am not sure which is better for a beginner. Until now I thought Glow forge was my only options for a self contained desktop laser with a camera and easy to use, now there is a choice, so the question is which one. Thoughts?",

Some diode lasers are advertised to be able to run up to 24000mm/min, which is equal to 400mm/s, so theoretically they could do the same as CO2 laser. Perhaps in case of 300mm/s even 40w optical power would not be enough fo good result, but I am confused why people are not running such tests on yt - usually they go up to 10000mm/min.",

Its been my workhorse for the small things I make, but has recently started stopping mid burn on everything even after multiple attempts with cleaning, customer support assistance, etc. So I decided I want to upgrade and was considering the 40w, but xtool is telling me I need to purchase a pro AND then the 40w like you said in the video. Kind of pointless to buy the pro when its only for the rail system and it would be waste of the laser. I wish they offered a complete 40w kit. Im considering throwing my hat into the co2 ring and going with an Omtech 50w. Currently its $250 off so its pretty close to the same price if I would purchase the pro and then the 40w upgrade. Whats your opinion? Keep up the videos too! Theyre very informative!",

I would like to improve speed with both engraving & cutting (I mainly engrave ceramic tiles, slate & mirror, but also glass & stainless steel) & would like to cut 4-6mm ply/mdf/acrylic. Would the RF CO2 laser still get similar quality on engravings at a much faster speed & would cutting be a lot better with the glass tube C02? Also, when engraving ceramic/acrylic/glass etc do C02 lasers still need the various paints to mark/burn materials? Thanks for this video btw (been waiting for your opinion)",

Good review, but you made a big error in the beginning - you've got the work area incorrect.(at 1:33) The dimensions you listed are the physical dimensions of the unit. The actual working area is 20.08\" (510mm)*11.47\" (290mm)*2(51mm). The dimensions you gave would have been awesome if they were correct :) Just thought you'd want to know so you can correct it.",
