Absolutely not made for professional use and even less for private use. Way too loud, poor cooling, extremely difficult to maintain if something breaks. And the worst part: the exhaust. When you use this laser, everything smells. It’s not sealed. This laser is far too expensive, and I would always prefer the Turbo 535 from Omtech. This laser is a marketing gimmick and not recommended.",

The camera will always move a tiny bit out of calibration.\nNot only that, but even if you really mount it as sturdy as possible and have the same thickness of material all the time, it will just by itself loose calibration within 2-3 runs.\nNot only that, even if you use fixed jigs (no camera), the laser itself isn't consistent in positioning, you may get 2-5mm shifts randomly.\n\nSo all in all the Lightburn camera alignment feature is just a collosal disappointment.\n\nIs that what you show in the video - randomly positioned material with accurate detection and accurate positioning - REALLY REALLY reality or is that staged B.S.? Does it REALLY get the content onto the material in the right angle, in the right place?\nCan there be a proper review of this feature, please?\n\nThanks!",

    "comment_text": "Nice reveiw,    very informative and entertaining.     I have to wonder about this machine as far as laser printing being compatible with paper and vinyl cutting.   Lasering is often a a smoky messy process,  the inside of a laser cutter needs a lot of cleaning.     It might be challenging to keep the sort of clean room environment you want for cloth and paper in the same environment with laser cutting.",

It would be interesting to know more about the material feeder that you show at the end, will there be a rotary tool and what is the max tumbler size with this small raiser base.",
