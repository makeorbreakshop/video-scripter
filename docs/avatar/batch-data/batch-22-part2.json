The crafter machines are getting multifunctional with printing/blade cutting modules, while the hobby ones focus on lasers.\n\nInstead of having an always ticked \"enclosure\" column, you should add important parameters missing from your sheet:\n* how the focus works: by moving the module or bed - as this limits functionality, you can't easily do curved surface processing when the whole bed has to move up and down\n* rotary attachment support - out of the box, with optional riser base, etc.\n* pass through / removable bottom plate\n\nBTW as far as I know WeCreat somehow shot off xTool (ex employees?) - their software is basically a clone of xCS 1.x.\nBTW2 you could have waited with this until the P2S review.",

    "comment_text": "I'm so tired of being told the lasers I own don't engrave metal. I've been engraving stainless steel knives since I've gotten both of my lasers one was a 10 W and the other is a 30 watt it just depends on the speed and the settings you use. it doesn't go that deep but it does work and its permanent. There are multiple videos on YouTube proving this, I'm not sure why the people that own CO2 lasers don't want to admit that dialed lasers operate this way, whatever",

They were SUPER helpful for learning and mastering Lightburn, but I was wondering if you are planning on doing any more that are specific to the Polar. I haven't found anyone else on youtube who is as easy to follow as you and who is covering the polar. This isn't our first rodeo- our main laser is an old beast from a defunct company in China, but sometimes all the bells and whistles are almost more complicated. I'd love to see videos on the camera, or more explaining how to use the z axis. I've got engraving down, but we're struggling with cutting through material in a reliable way. Thank you for all the videos you made so far!",
