It is a 7W diode that I will be upgrading to 10W soon on a approximately 5 ft x 5 ft frame (about 1400mm squared actual work space).  My other half and sister in law do a lot of sewn products for people, and being able to laser cut when you need 50 of the same pattern cut at a time is a huge timesaver.  It cost me around $1000 in parts to build plus a lot of time, but even a diode unit that large would be a few thousand dollars minimum.  I could have dropped that price by 3d printing more parts instead of using aluminum for 99% of the machine.\n\nI recognize that is not a good option for most people though.",

    "comment_text": "Thank you so much for all the amazing information!  For weeks now I have been exhaustively researching laser engravers for my first one.  I had pretty much decided on the Atomstack A5 Pro until I saw this video, and so glad I did!  The question I have is, can you please clarify the differences, if any, in the Atomstack models X7, A10, and S10?  I'm getting conflicting information from sellers.  Some say there is no difference in the three except for the color of the unit.  Another says \"S10 Pro is improved performance in all aspects than X7, also it can engraving material including wood, glass, stainless steel, acrylic, etc. and with faster speed and more better results.  This will be a better choice for all engraving and cutting enthusiasts.\"  My head is spinning and I figure if anyone can get to the bottom of this, you can!  :)  Thank you!!",

They insist I repair the laser.  I informed them I'm not an electronics tech and asked to have a new, working unit shipped to me.  They have refused and insisted I repair it after endless videos and photos had to be sent to them..",

    "comment_text": "I think the changes are a big negative for hobby users or those teaching themselves or in the pre-start-up phase.\n\nThey made 3 axis projects take a lot longer by removing rapids. A 3-hour project will now take 12 hours which is huge if you have to stand watching the machine (as most hobby users do). Not to mention the extra power usage...\n\nThey made 4 and 5 axis hobby cnc machines useless by removing that functionality completely. This limits what you can make regardless if it's a one-off hobby job or full production. \n\nManual tool changes have been made needlessly arduous as they now require a whole new operation.\n\nThey could have achieved the stated goal by simply limiting the hobby version to only posting to Mach 3 and Linuxcnc which no commercial VMCs use. \n\nMost of what they removed has nothing to do with commercial operations. It looks more aimed at forcing hobby users to pay for expensive subscriptions for the small handful of personal projects they do.",
