    "comment_text": "I was also split between the LM3 and D1. After watching every review I could find and then reading purchased reviews I decided that the Ortur was the way to go for me. First, the performance seemed to be slightly better when engraving and second but more importantly were the customer service oriented ratings. There seemed to be a trend towards a lack of customer service with xTool lately. I know there is a lot of turmoil going on in China right now so this is probably a temporary thing. Lastly, Amazon had a flash sale on the LM3 the other day making it $595 so I jumped on it. That left more money for accessories which we'll need to run these at there best. Just my 2 cents... \n\nCheers,\nGreg",

    "comment_text": "Engraving DPI is hugely important.  While I know 1200 DPI on a diode or fiber is doable, they are mainly marking machines (not cutting).  When I compared machines, I asked specifically about DPI ... they all report higher numbers than to be expected AND/or skipped around an answer ... their website numbers cannot be trusted.  The newer gen. machines have better motors than the 4+ yr old designs and can consistently do +800dpi, like the 2 co2 machines you mentioned.  There are more economy options that can perform, and there are more DIY coolers that aren't messy nor expensive.  I have a BOSS 70W and can cut/engrave basically anything I desire.  but it's older and doesn't have the newer motors (so the effective DPI is about 1/2 of the newer machines with the smallest focal lens), but it can be upgraded.  If it's a hobby, speed isn't as important ... precision is.  i would never spend less than $3k on any laser, period.  People ask when i give them stuff i make: \" You did what?\"  i say:\"yes, I'm a Jedi, I cut stuff with light\".  Diodes imo don't count.  I've used over 36 types of materials .. and my co2 hasn't failed me yet.",

    "comment_text": "If you're spending 4-7 grand on a machine, the learning curve is insignificant.  Once you've learnt it, you don't keep learning it.  What does matter, is the day to day experience of using it once you've climbed that curve.  For example. I have a great bean-to-cup coffee machine.  It makes great coffee, and I can tweak it to my heart's content, even though it's a clunky interface.  What is unforgiveable, is that every single time I turn it on, I have to wait for it to go through a cleaning cycle.  I can't put my cup under the brew head until it's finished, or it will fill with dirty water, so I can't just press a button and let it do its stuff.  Before it turns off, it cleans itself again.  It cleans itself so often, I have to refill the water really often, and empty the drip tray just as often.  I have another, much less fancy, less refined machine that I bought when the other broke down.  I can press the power button, and twenty seconds later press the button to brew the coffee, and a minute later I'm drinking espresso.  It's not quite as good at making my perfect coffee, but it's pretty good, it's harder to dial it in, it's noisier, and nothing like as polished, but in daily use it's so much more user friendly that I prefer it to my other machine.\nFor laser cutters, if you have to spend a couple of minutes getting the focus just right, or you need several trial runs to set the power/speed for each job, it doesn't matter how easy to learn it is, it's going to get tiresome pretty quickly.  Another machine might be hard to learn at first, you might need to build up a database of materials and power/speeds, but if, after doing that, all you have to do is insert the stock and press start, and know that it'll do the same good job every time, that machine will win every time.",

But when I try to engrave the diode starts half an inch off of the material and the image comes out about an inch smaller than the dimensions on the screen. I have none of these problems with the software XTool included with the laser though.",

What laser, i presume has a built in camera that can follow the shape of a drinking glass and adjust the laser automatically. Any idea anyone please? Cheers",
