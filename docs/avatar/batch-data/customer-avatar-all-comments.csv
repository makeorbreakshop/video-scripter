"UgwkuHeUNR_fEQuNNXt4AaABAg","Full Flight of Insta360 Weather Balloon Flight (Plus Fighter Jet Fly By!)","If you focus on the ground instead of the horizon, you will see an obvious distortion in several places on the lens, particularly at 2x speed. The fluctuation in the horizon is slight, but also apparent. The horizon does appear to have a curve later in the video, but the math is wrong on the curve based on the distance and current globe calculations, so we can assume that any fluctuating horizon is due to how the lens focuses the picture. The horizon is more steadily horizontal on the flight up, though again with slight fluctuating along the line. Another detail is that the horizon always stays at eye/lens level and never falls/curves away, indicating an ongoing plane (flat area) of Earth and not a rounded shape of Earth. Interesting to note is that there are no stars and there is no moon at this height.  To burn any assumptions, I'm neither a flat earther nor a round earther (nor any other shape earther). These items were interesting, so I thought to mention to them.","@tarawiselove","2020-12-25T15:59:06",3,2

"UgzgKiClnyYTJzn61_14AaABAg","What is the Best Laser Cutter and Engraver for You?","I actually have a CO2 laser that cuts metal. I imported a full size 4x8 table from China. It has two heads. I only paid $8500  The key to being able to cut metal is POWER. You need your laser tube to be rated at 180w (peak) with 150w nominal. So don't only get a 150w tube and think you've got enough power. (Maybe for super thin sheet metal) The way you can find out if the laser you are looking at can even begin to cut metal, is the head. They are significantly more chunky, look industrial. But they are known in the biz as ""Metal/Non-Metal"" heads. That's the phrase you are looking for. My table came with a water chiller, up/down front half table, 2 blower motor fume extractors, extra honeycomb top, rotary attachment and small aquarium pump. But I'm using a silent air compressor, it barely needs any real PSI above 40 anyway. And believe it or not, all of it runs on a 120v. (Even though I just converted the actual table to 220v, so I'm not tripping breakers running the water chiller, blower fans and an air compressor all at once. I had to do the extension cord thing across the shop for awhile to catch different outlets not on the same circuit)  More about the head I use to cut steel with... It can cut up to 4mm mild steel and 3mm stainless. Which is crazy to think about, considering the price point. The other thing you will absolutely need is a bottle of oxygen from a welding supply store. You only need to use that when cutting steel. So it's a minor cost factor even if you are just messing around. The other benefit of that particular head is that it can also cut 1"" thick acrylic, with glassy smooth polished edges. The secondary head I mentioned, I only use really for cutting thin stuff, most mostly engraving. I believe that one is rated at 80w peak.","@EcoMouseChannel","2020-12-16T00:21:41",0,0

Nor are any of them ever mentioned in the major trade publications like Engravers Journal.  There you will see article and advertisements for the true top laser engravers. that said I have a big problem with Full Spectrum Laser.  Having done business with both Trotec and Epilog  and having been involved with a number of different types of laser, I find FSL to be the worst company in the business that I know of.  I had a Muse engraver back in 2016. Having had better machines and knowing that the Muse was only a Hobby Laser, I still found it to be a big problem. Files would not load, the Claim that corel draw files were fully compatible a joke. Having a BS in Computer Information Systems (programming major) It was clear the first day that the software had serious flaws. The design part of the software would not even display properly. Some of the tools were partly hidden and there was no way to make them display or usable. The few things that I was able to draw would not save and be available in the main window. The machine itself was flimsy and the cheaply built. Mirrors were not aligned and not easy to align. The claim FSL advertised back in 2016 that the Muse does not need to be connected with the internet to work was a marketing ploy to try to get sales that might have gone to Glowforge. Bottom line here is the claim that the Muse did nt need to be connected to the internet is both true and misleading.  The true part is that the muse can be operated while not connected to the internet. What thye don;t say much about is the fact that you do have to have an internet connection and have the Muse connected to the internet and turned on. FSL sends updates to the Muse all the time. If your machine is not connected it does not receive the updates. History since 2016 has shown that many muse owners that had machines that worked one day found that their Muse would not work at all the next day (After FSL had sent an update).  FSL lies about capabilities of their machines. They advertised that a materials database would be into the Muse. It said that on their web site and I verified it with my salesman before buying. No Muse has ever had the materials database. After I made a fuss on several Facebook forums Full spectrum Laser removed any mention that the Muse was to come with the database.  My first Muse bluescreened the second morning I had it. I let FSL talk me into a replacement machine. Thy lied about that too. First they said that if I would let them send me a replacement machine they would ship it out that same day. And they claimed it would be fully tested and working as advertised. However, that is not what happened at all. FSL waited until my first machine got back to them. Second, the second machine had the exact same problems as the first one. There 30 day 100% refund policy is something they run from. If you call tech support they will try to help you. that is as long as you go along whit what they offer. As soon as you tell them that you want to return your machine for a refund, they stop responding to you completely. Lucky for me I was persistent. I called multiple times a day and send emails several times a day. No response for 8 days. When I did get someone to talk to me he informed me that they would not pay the return shipping. Had I bought a machine and then just decided that I did not want it, that would have been reasonable. However, when you get a machine that clearly has major problems and will not work as advertised they should pay for the return shipping. So I sent the Muse back at a cost to me of $271.73. Then when FSL received the Muse they took more than 30 days before refunding part of my money. Yes, that is correct. They have a restocking fee they take out of your purchase price. Again if i was returning a work machine simply because I did not want it, a restocking fee would be reasonable.  Before I shipped the Muse back I told the at Full Spectrum Laser that I did not think it was right to make the owner of a non working machine be responsible for return shipping and then to add insult to injury charge a restocking fee.  My comments to them were that if they gave me all my money back, I would go away. However, if they did not refund all my money I would make it a point to tell as many people as possible how they do business.  Long story short I lost well over $500 to FLS. The return shipping was $271.73. Then the restocking fee took another $250 of my refund.    The only concession here is I have for my trouble is I did make a fuss on a number of forums. After more than 2 years, I contacted the head guy. we had a phone conversation. At the end of that call FSL did refund my $250 Restocking fee. However, they refused to refund the $271.73 I paid to ship their Muse back to them.  Not to long after returning the Muse I started a fb group called Muse Buyers. There I now have well over 400 members. Some have Muse engravers. Several tried to return their machine for refund. FSL stalled and would not respond to them. once the 30 day refund period ends they will respond but will not take back your machine. To be fair, of the members of my group that own a Muse, a few  have only goo things to say about it. However there are more members that have a Muse that does not work.","@charlesstanley9605","2020-12-10T21:24:15",0,0

Seems like there's a bunch of improvements over the typical chinese laser, things that you won't see on a spec sheet and might not even appreciate until actually using it (or in my case, using an inferior laser with much to be desired).  I have a now discontinued bodor machine and it's just to subpar. There's a few videos on it but surprisingly, there aren't a lot of in depth reviews on laser cutters of any brand. For example, i can't find any videos going super in depth on trotec machines aside from the content that trotec puts out. Which to be fair, is very good quality.  Anyway some aspects that you don't hear much about:  - bed/table system (positioning, locking or other features) - quality of honeycombs (size, shape, material, framing) - depth under table and debris collection system if any - airflow design - air assist system and features  I think the reason is there's a very small crossover between buyers of the more expensive CO2 lasers and content creators.

"Ugw8lhtnnwcZNNnzAZx4AaABAg","Testing the OM Tech K40 Laser","I'm interested to see how you come along with this machine.  I really like mine but I'm inexperienced with laser engraving.  I've had 3d printers for years, so I like small CNC machines like this...   So far, I've mostly been playing around and working ON the machine doing upgrades, not so much WITH the machine, but that's not a complaint and not due to any fault of the machine. It worked 'fine' out of the box.   I wanted to mention the grounding to you though.  They paint the shell before they put the grounding hardware in.  You will likely find that you don't have a good earth ground to shell and it could be very dangerous.  Following advice of others, I removed the washer and ground it bare under the washer.  I also did the same under the PS, but prob was overkill.  I plan to replace the power inlet and 120 plugs on the back because they are garbage.  I also don't like the fact that full line voltage goes all the way to the power switch on the control panel then back down to the PS.  I want to replace the inlet with a better quality unit with dual pole switch built in so there is no voltage inside the control chamber at all when i have my hands in there. I wanted to make sure you and anyone else with one of these knew about the poor grounding since it's a pretty serious safety issue.   Before I fixed it, i did get a pretty decent shock by touching the edge of the sheet metal where the paint was thin.  Some people recommend to run a direct connection to earth ground with its own ground spike. (Do your own research though, I'm not an electrician just trying not to shock myself or burn the house down LOL)  You do need to get an ammeter in there asap so you can tell what's actually going on with laser power.  You simply connect it between Cathode of the laser tube and the PS.  If the needle moves backward, reverse it  Over all I'm happy with the OM Tech though.  I ordered a different ""K40"" at first.  When it arrived it had been dropped and dented badly so I returned it.  Long story short, the seller was a jerk so I eventually got it refunded by UPS and ordered this machine instead.  I'm glad I did.  This one is much sturdier and just generally better.  I've mostly been learning about the control system so far and upgrading the electronics.  I figure I should understand how it works and get everything working as well as possible before I actually start learning more about laser engraving.  I like to know my machines so I know how to repair them when they break. Like with drones, if you don't build it yourself, what are ya gonna do when ya crash it?? LOL  It's much harder to learn on a machine that isn't up to par.  We all know going in that these machines are good, but need upgrades to be great.  So far, I have mine running Marlin on a SKR1.4t.  With TMC2209s, its super quiet and both drivers and motors stay cool.  Having lots of inputs and outputs gives me lots of options for firmwares or things like Gcode/Macro Button control of case lighting and the red dot.  I'm working on adding a relay board today so I can do the same with air and water pump etc.  I added the smallest gas strut I could find to the door bc I accidentally slammed it shut a couple times lol.  I also ran an LED strip with a micro switch on the control side so it comes on like a fridge when I open the door LMAO.   It has been a bit of a bumpy road with Marlin though, so once I'm happier with my config ans engraving speeds, I'll share it so it's easier for others to use inexpensive boards like this instead of the pricey ones.  I believe Smoothie may even be more appropriate for lightburn and will run on SKR/MKS... Will find out later haha.  I haven't added air assist yet because I'm hesitant to order the wrong pump in effort to save $ and still debating, but it's time so I have to choose a compressor asap.    I really enjoy your work brother.  Keep it up","@jawa6988","2020-11-19T18:20:38",1,0

"Ugz4JvgpPa_FVZdyUHh4AaABAg","What is a 3D Laser Cutter?  Full Spectrum Muse 3D Review","I have had my Muse 3D for about eight months now.  As a machine and a piece of hardware I agree with your review:  this is an outstanding machine that looks great, is well designed and solidly built and cuts and engraves extremely well.  As with any complex device, you will encounter difficulties with various things (such as alignment and belt adjustment),  but their customer service has been outstanding and such issues are totally normal with any laser.  My issue with the Muse is  the software that runs it: re3.  In my hands, this is a horrible piece of software that is slow,  non-intuitive, confusing, constantly freezes my laptop, and is so frustrating to use that I may in fact sell my Muse because of the constant battles I have had with the software. I consider myself proficient with software and have used numerous programs, but at every turn, I have found difficulties with re3.   Interestingly,  re3 looks very similar to Lightburn,  but Lightburn is extremely well designed, intuitive, and  is an absolute joy to use.  It just has a polished ""feel"" and ease of use that re3 totally lacks.  In my opinion, re3 is a high school software project while Lightburn is sleek, professional and easy.  If only re3 were as well ""built"" as the Muse itself this would be an awesome combination.   One thing I have learned , and one should consider when buying a laser, is that when you purchase a proprietary device such as the Muse or the Glowforge for example, (I don't know anything about the Dremel)  you are totally dependent on the software and interface supplied by the respective companies.  For example, if Glowforge should fold as a company, your laser would be completely useless as it runs only via the company internet.  Although the Muse would not suffer a similar fate as the re3 software is on the machine, if you like re3, great, but if you don't, you are stuck.  So basically, by going with a proprietary machine you are exchanging the convenience of a ""plug and play"" device (obviously a great advantage) but totally giving up any flexibility or controlof the machine  to the respective company.  I sincerely hope FS Laser comes out with a useful re3 update soon.","@robertoutenreath4594","2020-11-13T04:16:16",2,1

"Ugxg5xiFxaEotlqym6R4AaABAg","Is Fusion 360 worth learning over Sketchup?","It seems like perhaps you don't know very much about skechup. Almost everything, not everything, but almost everythig you did in fusion you can do in sketchup. Are you aware of any of the following plugins; curviloft, sub d tools, flowify, soap,  bezier spline, curic stretch, fredo box stretch etc. There are so many plugins in sketchup that are extremely powerful for quick organic manipulation. I think there are some great points about fusion here but it's a poor comparison video because you don't talk about sketchup pro, why just talk about sketchup, sketchup pro is really where the power is, not sketchup because it's about the available plugins that are within sketchup that are incredible. You certainly don't have to go and do things from scratch like you mention in your video. I would say that after watching this and the lack of these comments that I've just mentioned that this video is a poor comparison video and you should perhaps be informed well on both products before you generalize the two together in a comparison because it's very confusing for people like in your comments section who are unsure about which they need for their modelling projects.","@arayahomes4308","2020-10-24T13:55:01",2,1

"Ugw7YSqAfIxpJxGnBW14AaABAg","Fusion 360 - Did Autodesk just kill the FREE Version?","Thanks for very informative information, I have autodesk licenses through my company, but not for fusion 360, I have need for others of there CAD software from time to time, they resently changed there network license to personal wich almost trippled my companys anual fee for something I need seldom, but when I need it I need it bad and can't be without it. For my personal use I used sketchup for the last 10 years or, so not realising the time saved with putting effort into parametric design, witch would have saved me alot of time with small changes in the design prosess with limitations of payed version. I am personally no converting to freeCAD and blender to mix my personal use since it is opensource and seems to have strong community. Of what I seen on youtube freeCAD can give me my needs for personal use and much more than I need without worring about license changes. Of cource many non autodesk files have caused problems in work since autodesk recognises that and put problems in import of what should be a standard format. Easier 3D modeling software are good to see what you need, but I wish I found parametric design software alot earlier, learning curve is alot steper, but only after a few models I see the win of making that extra effort. So to summary my thoughts, non parametric designs are if you have simple shapes you want and make one design and stick with it, if you have designs that can change small dimesions made in earlie stage without to mouch work go with parametric. Wiched I gone parametric now many years erlier. My finall thougt is that if you are planning to make future with 3D software and modelling for commersial use and get job in company, yes autodesk is most common and used around the world, but if you are a hobbyist or a small company protect your self about changes in future and look at opensorce prosjekts like freeCAD and Blender. I do pay for licenses when needed, but for non company use I only pay for the licenses needed, I try to keep paying atleast 1/3 to opensorce prosjekts if there is equivalent I can use to support further development. Even as smal programmer I believe that the creator sets the price, big or small creator , if you use product respect license conditions, support what you belive in. My first experience with autodesk I think is about 30 years ago with first computer lessons in architektural computing, autodesk has a stayed on top since then for comersial use along trimples sketchup with promise of free use for hobby , sorry to say I think commercial software as they think they won ground in uff they restrict the free for non commecial use to the  point it's  useless to hobbiest use. even if changes wan't as bad as most makers of youtube made it and thanks for that with your information, that where very informative, I still for personal use look for mor long terme stable solution for you as hobbist, for me it would be easier to keep to one, autodesk do not let me keep my persona fredom as hobbyist and my hobby programs to intergrate with my work at this time. So finalising my thoughts. Yes for work I need to keep up with Autodesk, but for my fredom in private I now fokus for freeCAd and blender, even thou reworking my models from sketchup that I need is a pain, putting alot of effort into lerning software that suddenly changes conditions is a pain, so as coclusion if you read all of this thoughts is,, if your going for learning for work at companies, this is good thing, but as hobbiest for your own use it is better to keep to opensource without restrictions. With my computer being both my personal and working I see complexity in many problems of free and non free versions, but I pay anual taxes for my personal computer and my own computer being the same, the same goes from my telephone that my company pais for and I get taxes for and can't get sirin sevices because of that. If you are new to parametric design I recommend freeCAD and put effort into that, if you plan yor 3D moddeling as work, definitly go with fusion 360. I would surtinality make good thougt about making in freeCAD and 360 videos in future compared to make same in fusion 360, my company gives me licenses if I say I need them without quistion, thats there fault, most licenses could be avoided so investors are at total loss. I do not care about that, if anyone been reading throuhg this it is about proos and con I can think of, there is no simple answer. No english is not my first language, nor do I intend it to be, best regards from Sweden. With all kritics it still the best informative video of fusion 360 autodesk changes in users agrement and priviliges.

Bought a new power supply and Main processor from Light Object and got machine back up and running. Quite different software to learn, but, now I prefer it.

I am struggling with my birch butcher block, omg what a nightmare, i am having to remove all the poly and stain right now. I am worried about making the same mistake. The poly looked horrible, i think we used a minwax Oil based poly, on top of my Kona Gel stain .. .I think we did the same thing with the stain i didnt let it sit long enough and wiped to much off. it looked nice in the begging but the next day it was faded quit a bit. But it wasn't that bad., WE covered it with some poly and it was horrible looking made it look faded even more??? no idea why? I put down a the butcher block oil on the butcher block before staining not a oil based pre stain. I have no idea but i am looking for idea on what to cover my stain with, i do NOT LIKE POLY at all.

Then so you dont throw your $ in the ocean....buy a K40 laser. Ya i know, its chinese, its unsafe, etc, etc..... you dont have to be a rocket scientist with these....i bought one on amazon, did a tweek here and there. I use inkscape (free)....and scorchworks (free) to use this K40 laser, and it works great....dont have to deal with chinese software.... you learn alot, the cost is super minumum.... if you dont like it, or you get bored with it, sell it on craigslist for  $200....lesson learned. sooooo. to wrap things up.....Couple years ago, i built my own. bigger and better c02 laser and still using free software. Cost me $1500 to make, and i have more than made up the cost to make it.....life treating me fine right now....retired. Learned off the K40, reading reviews, watching you-tube videos......then make your own.....cant tell you how many people have made their own.....a ton.","@glennmartonic6376","2020-07-25T20:44:32",1,2

Tried everything and apparently the laser itself has failed so I attempted to contact support at GearBest. This is where it has gone terribly wrong - they simply do not respond to requests of any kind. Is that because of Covid19? Don't think so as I could live chat with them, they are sending out advertising emails, and there is nothing on their site about the Coronavirus. So, the live chats end with ""you will be contacted in this regard in 24 hours or less"" which I have been told on three separate occasions and received nothing. Opened tickets on their support site are closed without any followup within a day or two and sent emails that go unanswered.    Nice.   So I would stay away from this product and GearBest.com at all costs and just spend the extra money on a real laser engraver rather than this junk from China. You get what you pay for.

"UgxP8R1SFem2Cvj_V_J4AaABAg","Is Fusion 360 worth learning over Sketchup?","I'm pretty deep into Sketchup and just a baby at Fusion 360.  Sketchup crashes a lot (for me). And it can't import-export unless you want to cough up a good chunk of changed.  I can get quite a bit done. Sketch-u-cam helps a lot. It's a bit limited and buggy too.  It's a bit early in the game but F360 looks quite promising. I'm already doing things in it that would be completely hairy in sketchup.  I'm going to argue that Sketchup is great at the beginning since you can get going pretty fast with it and there's a reasonable gamut of stuff you can do with it using a 2.5D methodology. Great for the dating stage with your cnc machine.    But if you are going to marry your cnc machine a person should add F360 to the mix. You'll be able to delve deeper.","@DarcyWhyte","2020-04-24T03:57:17",0,0

"UgxJ5VEbrqwpWRmhESV4AaABAg","Is Fusion 360 worth learning over Sketchup?","Some nice information! However, I'm still not convinced... Lots of the stuff you showed like resizing the countertop and drawer can be done very quickly in Sketchup as well. I see all these tables and screens full of dimensions and numbers, but I think with some experience you will be faster in Sketchup in the end, since it's so easy to use.   For the organic sculpting there are very good and simple to use plugins for Sketchup. And as for printing, Sketchup can export directly to STL as well, I use it for 80% of my printer modeling (and some blender sometimes). The built-in slicer in Fusion is cool, but if you're used to a normal slicer like Cura or Slic3r already, this doesn't have much more value over using Sketchup.   About rendering...  I actually use Sketchup for this professionally,  with a plugin called Twilight Render. It may not be as powerful as for example Vray ( which also costs an insane amount of money), but it can make REALLY realistic renders, better than anything i've seen coming out of Fusion.   Now... I'm not saying that Fusion is bad; If you want to do some complex and organic modeling and product design, though it can be done, it's not very easy in Sketchup. For extremely parametric stuff, like the lego bricks you showed us, this will be better as well. But I still think people really write off Sketchup too quickly, and often overlook what that piece of software can do with some additional plugins, ESPECIALLY for interior design and non-organic stuff like that. The workflow and interface sure are infinitely more intuitive and simple than any other modeling software out there...   You're free to use what you want of course, both are valid options, but don't underestimate Sketchup if you like a really hands-on and intuitive workflow.","@RinyuuSenpai","2020-04-22T20:43:15",2,3

Run pure distilled water only and put a couple drops of dish detergent and a cap full of bleach in it.  If you don't want to use bleach, then at least add fish tank bio killer in the water to prevent it from going stagnant over time.  Using antifreeze or ""water wetter"" products and the like is bad, because it cooks into the glass and actually will eventually build heat on the tube, as will minerals in the water if it's not pure distilled.  Don't listen to these dopes.  I've been running home built units for years now and have done the research for 10 men. Also invest in a CW-5000 chiller and be done with it.

"Ugy6g9ITIvPH7Wtt5xR4AaABAg","Does a $200 Laser Engraver Make Sense in Your Shop?","Also, worth noting, those included glasses aren't rated for the laser on the machine. The tint vs color of the laser is a dead giveaway. If you look at any laser engraver and many high powered laser pointers of similar wavelength, the protective shielding or goggles are orange. It's basically a principle of opposing colors. It helps if you think of the color of the goggles cancelling out the color of the laser. In this case, the blue laser light is extremely close to the green goggles on the color wheel. The goggles let light in and around the green wavelength through. For the goggles to be effective in blocking the blue laser light, they should be red, or preferably orange, the opposing color to blue.   Since they aren't clear or blue goggles, they are probably blocking some of the harmful light, but I definitely wouldn't trust my vision to them, especially if they were included free with a cheap and cheerful, safety measure delete laser engraver.  Edit: It might be worse than I thought...I was just basing this off of a combination of my knowledge of optics, confirmed by the high end laser related products I've seen. I just looked it up and found this video. It looks like he has a pair of the included glasses, and they fail to even block an LED, so if you're staring at the laser light, you're probably roasting your retinas. https://youtu.be/upCsVrKrW7M  He also has an epic accent.  Edit 2: Here's a video that goes more into depth on what you should look for in goggles to protect yourself. I am pretty confident that the ones included above are just green plastic, with no laser rating whatsoever. If one is listed, I'd be willing to bet that it's utter BS.  Long and short of it, if you're gonna save a buck on your laser engraver, don't skimp on the PPE to go along with it. Or you'll be giving yourself anti-lasik.  Final Edit: I'm also only considering the harmful potential of the unshielded laser module. This is ignoring the carcinogen laden fumes it's outputting. There is a reason laser cutters are enclosed both behind laser shielded material AND have their own filtration and extraction systems. This could also very easily start a fire if you're not watching it like a hawk, and even if you are, I can see a mosquito fart knocking it over, or it overshooting the material it's engraving and scorching the surface beneath it.   As much as I want a laser cutter, this seems like a bad idea. 3d printers and CNC routers are one thing to downsize and lose all the safety gear. The damage they can do is pretty limited to localized burns and possibly losing a digit to a router bit. Laser cutters are next level dangerous.","@neobaggins3718","2020-02-05T08:29:50",0,1

To mess around and learn a bit while possibly making useful trinkets... these little machines are a good start.  Low cost and see if you are actually going to do anything at all with it.  When you find that the stuff you want to CNC carve is not going to be able to be done on the little machine, change it to a laser engraver and get a better CNC machine.  These little things will make some nice looking coasters and key chains and carve the color layered plastics for small signs.  Not good for engraving brass really.

"UgwFoGMx4npqhyKrCG14AaABAg","6 Mistakes Not to Make When Building a Farmhouse Table","I'm about to say something that will make the wood movement police go crazy. But whatever. Lol. My experience supports it.   Wood movement... It's a ""common tale"" that as external humidity changes, so will your projects... Well... That's honestly not the case if you have your home well insulated and at a consistent humidity. Which most houses are. Most antique furniture doesn't break from wood movement when sitting in a house.... They break from wood movement when people put them in garages and barns where there is no climate control. Then the wood movement starts setting in and everything gets all crazy. And also .. wood movement can be overpowered and controlled. Just look at high quality sheets of veneer ply.   If you are building something for an interior job, honestly it will likely shrink a little over the next 1-6 months when bringing it in from your shop (especially if your shop isn't well controlled with it's humidity and temperature .)  I've sold very expensive veneered signs, laminated chess boards with highly figured cross grain, and even tables with cross grain on them. As long as you expect a little shrinkage and it's gonna be climate controlled.... You honestly don't need much for wood movement.   You don't believe me? Go to the Las Vegas airport and go to the Jamba Juice inside the terminal. There is a hickory table there with no proper breadboards, held all together with glue and dominos. Breaks all the rules and it's perfectly flat and strong with perfect joints.   Also, the Samurai Carpenter and many of my fellow pro woodworker friends agree with me. Yes wood moves. But not as much as people think on indoor furniture. And a little known fact about wood glue.... It's actually not a true solid once cured. It can allow for a surprising amount of wood movement and shifting and still keep it's bond. Honestly man you could have just glued and mortise and tenoned that baby on for the breadboard. The bigger issue isn't the breadboard... It's the fact that you are using construction lumber. The 2x6s are gonna get way more contraction than just going down to the hardwood store and buying poplar. And it actually will be surprisingly similar in cost.

One thing I want to add is that you should always be wearing laser goggles when The machine is on. This is true even if the laser is in low power mode. Even in low power mode I'm sure it could blind you instantly if you got a reflection just right. Given the price level of these things are built to it's also entirely possible for the laser to just go into high power mode on its own to do some sort of circuitry or programmatical failure. A good quality set of laser goggles is probably the most important thing you can buy when dealing with anything laser.

I took the red shield off of my Z1. It was getting crudded up w/ debris. For cutting thicker materials it also gets in the way because there's only a 2mm gap at optimal surface focus.  I made a temporary enclosure out of cardboard and piped in a 170cfm (advertised flow) exhaust blower. It's not ideal or the safest enclosure material, but I never leave the laser unattended when in operation and have a small ABC extinguisher nearby. The blower is marginal for extracting the smoke, but that's likely due to the ""enclosure"" having an open front.   Mine is good to etch at faster than 9000, but at those speeds I haven't tested the accuracy. For slate coasters, it will even produce a textured surface at medium speeds.","@OldCurmudgeon3DP","2021-12-30T17:04:14",2,1

They say it works now with lightburn, well it does not.    I have had nothing but problems with it.  It crashes into the wall all the time.  When you tell it to home, it crashes into the wall.  If you try to frame your work to tell where you need to put you material, it crashes into the wall.  There are no limit switches on this laser so it has no idea where it is.  If you want to put your work in the middle of the field, well good luck.  I tried everything and it would only work in the upper left corner.  There is no emergency stop switch, so if you have a problem you have to fumble  around for the power switch.  Not something you want to do if you have a real problem.  I ordered the rotary with this laser but did not get it.  I had to contact support to find out that it was on backorder, and they never even thought to email me to let me know.  There is no factory air assist with this laser, and that would defiantly come in handy.  Their setup video is horrible.  It moves so fast that you can't really tell what they are doing and what part that are using.  I have to say DON'T buy this if you are new to laser engraving, and even if you are a seasoned  person it will be hard to get it to work properly.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from this laser.  Sorry to put this up but I think it will help a lot of people.  This is not a well thought out machine. Yeah it looks sexy and well built but it's not worth the price at all.  I will be getting an Ortur for sure. I do think that you can learn a lot from this channel though.  He really seems to know his stuff.

Atomstack X7 Pro Laser Engraver Review","I would love to hear your advice actually I've been looking at your videos now for quite a while because I am getting more and more interested in buying my own laser cutter. I have a lot of experience with MDF as well as resin printers. Even before I used to go to the city workshop where I operated with their CO2 Laser (HyperCUT 6090 PRO).  I can print a lot of things with my printers but still I would love to be able to cut and engrave stuff.. + with wood you get that warmer feeling if you give some sort of gift. I would love to have a machine that is capable of cutting good as well as engraving. Mostly I would cut some sort of stands and smaller chests or boxes for storage or decoration. material wise; Foam, MDF, acrylic and vinyl. So with this cutter it's really, really tempting. Price is fair, even though I was always in love with Co2 lasers and dreaming about getting one because of speed and enclosure and everything else. I also looked at some of your other videos like OM Tech K40 and its bigger 50w brother but with K40 the problem is cut volume and with 50w machines the problem is price. So if you were in my position, which machine would you recommend me getting? Should I save up the money and buy bigger CO2 for like 1500 - 2000€ or should these smaller diode machines work well enough for me?

I bought it for the 10w laser, but had I known it would not use industry standard software, I would have made a different choice. By the way, do not upgrade from laserbox basic 1.1.0 to 1.0.1 it breaks the positioning ability on the burn screen.  The earlier version works when you try to position the laser using the buttons to go left, right, up or down.  On the new release, it seems to be very harsh on the motors and the laser starts moving diagonally (not in a straight line) as intended.

Second, Meerk4t will allow a lot more flexibility to your laser power, I think it does fast switching rather than varying the power.. It's not in Lightburn territory but it's way better than Whisperer and it's free. Third, the fan is upgraded, most now come with a perfectly adequate fan, rather than that dire fan on earlier models. Remove the internal ducting and you have really good extraction. This means that you will only be spending around $100 for air assist and mirrors to get a very workable machine that competes with the Glowforge on most jobs.","@Graeme758","2021-11-09T10:10:33",5,0

"UgwA6ME5nQQKl6vIyOR4AaABAg","The Nicest Laser Engraver This Year? The xTool D1 Review","Very informative reviews. One note: You have the endemic YouTuber problem. Not as bad as most but still pretty irritation. You wave and flail things you are holding as if we should look at them, but we can't. Check when you ""show"" the piece of basswood. You would not flip and wave it in the face of a friend would you? Part of this is also the wild arm wavings and gesticulations like you are doing a rap concert. I bet you do not do that in person either, or maybe people just stand well back to avoid injury. This breaks the personal experience of the video and gives some ""This Old House"" vibe (meaning poorly scripted, over acted). Basically you act like you are speaking to an audience, but you are not. On YouTube you are speaking one-on-one. Just my 2 cents. Keep up the good work.","@BobChaz","2021-11-07T23:17:04",0,0

I cant get xtool d1 shipped to my country(Serbia). And is it better to order from aliexpress or from official site, because sometimes the difference in price is arond 50-100$. By the way i love your videos, they are very detailed. Sorry for the gramatical errors my english isnt the best.","@markomarinkovic5350","2021-10-25T17:51:51",1,1
"Ugx5OzImyQtyYI1VEPB4AaABAg","The Nicest Laser Engraver This Year? The xTool D1 Review","Great review! I've been waiting for some in-depth info on the D1 for weeks now. I am wondering, though, how it would do cutting very thin hardwood. They claim it can cut 6mm Basswood in one pass. My main use for a laser is cutting through 1.5mm hardwood (.062) of different species (Maple, Cherry, Walnut, etc). If you ever have a chance to check out that capability, I'd lover to know how it goes. I have a Glowforge now, but when it dies, I'd love to find a cheaper alternative. Thanks again for the detailed laser reviews!","@RepLedZep","2021-10-25T16:31:57",1,0

"Ugw8wB2qREQ9djc-enZ4AaABAg","SparkMaker LaserPro: The new King 👑 of budget laser engravers?","The software that is shipped with the LaserPro is buggy and and not very powerful. LaserPro is not compatible with Lightburn - yet - they are working on it. However after several weeks playing with it, I found that with a very simple GCODE header and footer added to the Lightburn configuration file, the LaserPro will (mostly) run with Lightburn. It has a very small spot and is very powerful. It easily cuts 3mm plywood at 225mm/min at 95% power, and engraves literally everything. It has an internal fan that provides air assist, blowing air from the same orifice as the laser, and the lens is recessed in the laser head so smoke does not settle out on the lens. The auto focus works great, and the enclosure with the fan lets you vent the smoke out a window. The video camera takes a bit of careful setup but is extremely useful. When the LaserPro is fully Lightburn compatible it will definitely be the diode laser engraver to buy. My LaserPro is now the one I use for all my projects, and my previous laser engraver (which I was very happy with) sits pretty much idle.","@robertmoran9225","2021-10-25T03:23:35",3,6

The big thunder we have has like a 3ft × 4.5ft cutting area which seems insane, but one thing we have noticed with it is that the laser's cutting power gets weaker as you move away from the source, so you can't really utilize the full cutting area as easily.  That's probably just as issue with such a large laser, so keep that in mind.

Was just about to go for the Ortur LM2 Pro when I saw this video. Eithers' most difficult and frequent use case would be for a teacher cutting paper, cardboard, and occasional thin (6mm or less basswood/balsawood) for young student projects. Along with doing engraving for gifts and occasional sales (once or twice a year flea markets, no online shop).  Would a 4"" hose and exhaust fan to outside *near* the xTool be enough in a basement shop? I've got preexisting 4"" exhausts running for airbrush and resin 3d printers. Or should we really use an enclosure?  Really like the xTool build quality and what seems to be a better laser module with dual diode. ""Good enough"" software doesn't seem to be a problem since it doesn't need a persistent online connection like glowforge. The big thing that has me hesitating on this xTool is that the Ortur has an optional enclosure, seems to have more reviews, more mods, and more units actually out there in the hands of hobbyists.","@RideShagbark","2021-10-22T21:41:25",0,3

But also want to engrave/scorch leather and woodies(multipex/plywood most likely)  Maybe engrave aluminium but I realise there are specialised laser(lenses) for that particular operation.  Got max 5k to spend. Looking for a ROI within a year. (Things I sell will be around €5/€25 a product, around 5000mm distance in lines per product)  It's mainly hobby orientated. I want to comfortably be out for work during the day while it is running. Ofcourse I have a contact in the appartement that could keep an eye on things and unplug the field if necessary.

"UgyJMVVBB5DEnUXkIvl4AaABAg","Is Fusion 360 worth learning over Sketchup?","Good video, however just about everything you said sketchup cant do.....it can. For one, model using dynamic components. You can not only change sizing on the fly but you can also animate door openings, drawers and check for collisions etc. This is HUGE! You can change material thickness etc. Rendering....well, that depends on what you are trying to accomplish. Sketchup uses companies like VRay and Lumion..... Fusion 360s internal renderer cant compare. That does require an additional software purchase, but being that was a point brought up I assume we are focusing on quality of render potential and Vray simply cant be touched. One huge advantage Sketchup has over Fusion 360 is Layout, the quality and ease of use to create amazing drawings is a big need for me. Again both of these programs are solid, it just depends on what you are doing and what you need. I would not count sketchup out as it is very powerful, and even more so when paired with quality plugins. I do like Fusions CAM capability though, I currently export to Aspire, but 3d shapes would  be nice to toolpath on screen like that. Thanks for the video!","@5000yearleap","2021-10-06T05:05:22",1,2

"UgwyFP-9JsweEp5Ymwd4AaABAg","The Best Laser Cutter for any Budget?","The ORTUR looks like it be good for some DIY 3D printer, with some modifications.  I worked at a place that used a type of plastic powder, in the consistency of baby powder. Wile sitting in it's shaker, it looked like bubbling liquid. Wile in that state, it is sucked up with a positive charge added to it, and sprayed on a metal part with a negative charge, to make the powder paint stick to it. After, it goes into an oven to melt the plastic onto the metal as a covering. Comes in many colors.  If one was to have a table that a slider arm will lay out a thin layer of that powder onto a table, the ORTUR could be use to trace out the shape of one layer to a 3D part. The table would drop by one layer, as the slider arm adds another layer of powder. The ORTUR traces out that next layer, before the table drops again. Repeat, until all layers are complete.  Use a small vac to suck up the unused powder, and you got a 3D part. Trick is, getting the ORTUR to be part of that automated task. Could be make possible with a Raspberry PI I think.  Would prove to be a neat project. And cost vastly less than other 3D printers that do such already costing over 15,000 for a low end 3D printer of that type.","@glenfoxh","2021-10-03T20:03:47",1,0

I also haven't bothered to upgrade the controller board, the original works just fine for my workflow with K40 Whisperer.

Back then you connected to it, as a printer, so Epilogue provided a print driver. Being older it had no USB, so it has a parallel printer port connector. But I ""printed"" thru Corel Draw, which would both cut and engrave. The engraving portion, was provided with a simple image file format (.jpg, .png, .bmp, etc), and the cutting with a vector format (.dxf), that I imported into corel, to make the final file, to be engraved & cut out. Is this still an option on modern engravers ?

Having been screwed by a company going out of business, turning my 3d printer into a brick, I will never buy tools like these that require an online service (as opposed to web-based software served up from the tool, like most routers). For the price of something like the glowforge, I'd want to ensure I could use it for as long as I decide to.

Water flow using supplied pump and distilled water are fine, although the rubber tubing supplied is crap and folds readily, with a series of clothes pegs, I have been able to press it open along full length providing no restriction to water flow. Power switches on and off to the machine okay, emergency stop working fine, temperature LCDs and Power LED working fine, as are the adjustment buttons. No damage to the box it came in or obvious damage inside, laser tube is watertight ie no cracks visible and no leakage. Set laser power to 30% following instructions in the instruction manual for mirror alignment on mirror 1, set masking tape across mirror  1 and pressed the pulse button. Result - no laser beam, and no burn on the centre of masking tape. Tried beam switched on constant, still no purple laser beam in the tube (as appears at time point 1.20 on the video) or burn on paper. I have tried increasing and decreasing power and temperatures in the tube have remained about 28 degrees C. My machine does not appear to have a flow switch, having pulled the tubes both ways in the casing to their full possible extent.

Personally, I think it is painfully slow. when I first started looking for a laser, I saw reviews just like this, and got all fired up and excited.  however, after digging deeper, checking out the specs, comparing this to others on the market, and then factoring in the total lack of actual support ( other than the community forums ), having to return the unit to even replace a tube, and for almost every other things, at. great cost - I soon realised, this was actually not a great machine for the money they are demanding for it.  It looks very nice, but, it just doesn't command the price.    they do an excellent job of marketing, an immense job, but they they would ( in my opinion ) provide a much better product, with support if they pent less on the advertising and more into the product itself.  Once I made an initial enquiry, I was almost hounded by e-mail after e-mail after e-mail.  however when I replied with questions, their answers were always very vague, or often they would deviate from my question, paying lip service to it only, and trying to big up everything else in an attempt to negate my concerns, and convince me that despite my concern, there were so many other aspects that were simply amazing...anyway... hard pass for me im afraid  I love your reviews in general, but I do have to say, I think this one was probably biased as a result of glow forge sending you the laser and air purifier etc..I know you said it wasn't, but it did sound like it.","@LowVisionUKTerrysView","2021-08-20T00:47:12",2,0

"UgwrwzsBmmKHaArccIN4AaABAg","Should you upgrade a budget laser cutter?","I started in March with an Ortur Laser Master 2 Diode machine to dip my toes in and see if I liked laser engraving. Last month I had a OmTech 60w CO2 machine with 20""x28"" build surface delivered (eBay).   Got Lightburn when I had the Ortur and was a simple process to upgrade the license to work with the Ruida controller on the 60w machine.  Makes for an amazingly capable machine with plenty of power for my current goals.  I don't think there's anyway I'd be satisfied with a Glowforge.  Proprietary software, internet connection required, and could become a brick any day if the company ever shut down.  Note: Ortur machine sold on Facebook Marketplace within 24 hours for about what I paid for it (of course I included all my upgrades so it was certainly more valuable than stock).","@TheMugrad2002","2021-08-19T16:44:14",2,1

But there are too many limiting factors, especially the closed ecosystem, where even if the company does not fold, you are beholden to their marketing changes.  Just ask any Cricket user of the last couple of months.  Yes, Cricket backed out of their proposed changes, but for a while, there was the potential to basically owning a brick..  Should Glowforge find itself in financial difficulties, what is to stop them from charging for functionality that already exists and is part of the package, or jacking up the cost of their subscription service, after people have integrated the glowforge into their process (if commercial).

"UgxgVVQe4SMdTtC2Vg14AaABAg","Should You Buy a Glowforge?","The reviewed equipment adds up to basically $7000. A quick look at OMTech shows you can get 100w, 24x40 (and passthrough), autofocus, a much deeper maximum depth (tumbler engraving anyone?), an actual chiller, two different styles of rotary machines, Corel graphics suite, and Lightburn for $6360. You'll have $640 left to spend on a camera for Lightburn so you'll have the same functionality as SlowForge. You'll also have a much bigger machine with more than twice the power and the ability to fix small things like laser alignment (good luck re-aligning your shiny new Glowforge if it gets bumped during shipping). The only thing you'll be missing is the air purifier and there are plenty of cost effective options out there.  Glowforge shouldn't be compared to a cheap k40; it should be compared to what else you can get for the cost. For the cost, there are much better options.  Btw, their $3000 basic machine gets equally spanked by a 50w OMTech. They do have great advertising though and the entire laser community has benefitted from it.","@kevinh3447","2021-07-27T21:35:16",9,3
"UgxkIfc20nNghYn5ibh4AaABAg","Should You Buy a Glowforge?","Personally for the cost, I would rather a 50w and lightburn, sure you will need a chiller and a bigger extractor, but the inability to be able to use a rotary, or a decent thickness of wood and the low power, the hard to clean, the fact you cant repair anything on it your self... Give me a machine I can work on my self every day of the week.   also closed ecosysytem for software nope sorry thats where pain comes, give it a few years and when glowforge decide they don't want to support it any more tough! (See Cricut for example of this happening)   Having a sealed path is a terrible idea in my view, replacing mirrors will be needed in the future and I bet that's a return to glow forge for them to do it and if its not then it will be an expensive option .  A few questions,  1) How long is the laser tube? cos it doesnt look like a real 40W have they done the trick of saying its peak and using that as a selling point, it looks (to me at least) more like a 35w tube.  2) What's the fluid used for the cooling? does it have a decent amount of fluid in it? considering the size of most chillers they are bigger than the whole machine so what is it using?  3) What's the max cutting and engraving speed?  4) How easy to replace the lens? and how expensive?    My personal opinion is they are over priced and they also could do with someone understanding lasers doing the marketing (its not a printer for example) and to be honest they have a really bad reputation for going wrong due to things like ribbon cables, I guess they are the apple of the laser world, more expensive than a better option and a closed ecosystem ....

"UgxoBJUvy01h8Lux_OJ4AaABAg","This Laser Can Engrave METAL!  -  OMTech 20W Fiber Laser Review","The fiber laser is unique in that the fibet itself is whar creates the laser light  or more specificly the excited ions doped within the lattice of the crystal or glass fiber. Most of the time or at least for consumer focused fiber lasers they are pumped with a powerful    bank  of LEDs which is the excitation source stimulating the emission of radiation. These types of lasers can be significantly less expensive for maintenance as well as initial cost thanks to the more simple beam path. Obviously there are many other factors involved in the cost of the unit and  quality of the beam,  spectrum of the beam , how the beams pulse shape  and duration are controlled ,  or if it has a continuous wave stable  beam... sorry,  i love lasers haha","@traviskeller3641","2021-07-03T21:48:20",2,1

Probably the single most important test and one most people are going to be wanting to know more than anything (even if it never crossed their mind)! So how about it, how about REALLY putting it to the test and let us know how long we can expect it to survive before it burns out? The biggest issue with these diode lasers is they are weak and have such dismal life expectancies if that was known before the purchase people would not waste their money and it bothers me that someone like you that works with all types of lasers all the time, at least thats what you claim, one would think you are aware of this major issue!

I have paid over $40,000 (Australian)  for Solidworks over the years and that is cheap compared to ProEngineer (Creo) and UniGraphics that preceeded it, but Fusion is way superior, especially if you need to use CNC etc, the Delcam / FeatureCam / HSMWorks tech rolled into Fusion is outrageously good for the price.

I want to get into a Laser Engraver but of course there is so much info to digest and make decisions on.    Because of the COVID virus we have now lost the only place I would have gone to look at and ask questions about it.  That is FRY's Electronics.  I was going to build a newer computer with newer components.  I like to buy locally and now there is no second choice place to go.  The whole printing and engraving environment is changing so fast I have been deliberately slow to get involved and jump in.  Would you be able to make suggestions on where to focus if I mentioned some of the criteria involved?  1)  Engrave small objects like in the size of Keys, Knife handles and up to the size of 6 inches square for just a little more versatility;  2)  Because of size - price should be small due to the versatility and usefulness is reduced (comparatively);  3)  Precision - due to the size of the engravings they will be examined closely.  4)  Engrave or etch but NOT cut through.  5) Small because of my needs and can't have it take up a lot of room.   6)  Engrave any metals that will dis-color noticeably.   All these are valid reasons that must be evaluated together.     If you can please give me a few suggestions.  Because I don't know what the prices may be, please consider price to be of the lesser requirement.  I want a good one that will do the job.

Research your seller to make sure good customer service is available. I haven't had problems and I've used it for about 8 months regularly. I also never cut at 50% to help save my CO2 laser, but thats a personal pref. Never look directly at lasers, always get glasses but you still shouldn't look directly at it with glasses on either.  Also research what materials you are cutting because gases released can be harmful if youre ignorant of what you're cutting. Hope this helps and glhf :)","@shimmydamper7940","2021-02-05T16:03:09",1,1

Otherwise people will think a galvo can be only uses with fiber lasers which is wrong. It's probably more feasible to use this combination, since fiber lasers usually have a better beam quality than diode lasers (up to 1/100, with one beeing the best and going to inf) and 1/10th the wavelength of CO2. Both increase the ability to focus the beam.","@Famok","2022-12-30T18:58:04",2,0

"UgzTFLR8dQQTVrDQ4Bp4AaABAg","This Laser Can Engrave METAL!  -  OMTech 20W Fiber Laser Review","Why are galvo lasers not used on a gantry?  it seems like galvo = small work area but fast travel, gantry = slow but big work area. why not do a galvo head on a gantry to get a large work area and a wider (not directly downward) beam on a gantry?  If the galvo head is coupled to a wire source (or other pump configuration), the galvo head should be easily movable relative to the diode bank (my understanding is that fiber optic fibers/wires/cables are flexible and durable).  if the gantry could move the galvo head over a large area, that might also mitigate the other con of galvo heads you mentioned (sub optimal angles at limits of galvo head), because the galvo head wouldn’t need to be pushed to reach as far to yield a work area that seems competitive (it could stay within an optimal angular range relative to the travel of and on the gantry).

I will say that since seeing them introduce the subscription service and push it so hard, I've had the constant sneaking worry that one day they'll try and lock all function of my glowforge behind a paywall, but so far they haven't done that.  I only ever upload designs so I have no need for the subscription.  If they ever do decide to brick it for a subscription (or go under and their webclient ceases to be), I'll look at other companies, but I can't afford to upgrade as long as I've got a working laser already.  Despite my overall very positive experience with glowforge, I don't think I'd recommend them to someone now, when you can get a more powerful laser that can run in house software for less money.  When it was 2k, it was also one of the only really user friendly lasers on the market, and one of the cheapest lasers.  At twice the price, and still locked into glowforge's online software, I just don't see why anyone would pick it over a competitor.","@902496","2022-12-07T22:17:44",43,3

In my actual experience, every issue is responded to (in emails - no return calls) is to clean everything and refocus the machine.  In fact, they didn't even read my email, which asked about being able to buy the on/off pushbutton switch that is sticking, and their response was to ignore me.  I asked to pay for a service call.  At this point I have actually convinced two people to buy a competitors model and I am working on my third person.  I purchased the laser and requested support from the Anaheim California location, but I have not seen anything to let me know that the entire company is not represented by the same lousy service.  I would be fine with their lack of help, but even when I asked if there was anyone who could help, I was met with silence.  I was finally able to find someone who does service for Laser in LA, and I was happy to pay for the help.  I am very disgusted with Omtech's complete lack of service.

I bought it thinking I could use it as a semi-portable.    Here's my thoughts:  1) Not really meant to be portable.   2) Very fast from uncrating to lasering. 3) In Lightburn, unless I'm missing something, the focus (z-offset) has to be set for every layer. 4) Camera calibration was easy - except a bit inaccurate (so I guess not as easy as it seemed).  It would not even detect the dot pattern unless I opened the lid part way.  It seemed like Lightburn doesn't like the 180 pano camera lens, but this is my first machine with a camera.   I'll fiddle more tomorrow.","@oldNavyJZ","2022-12-03T06:23:29",1,0

NO ONE uses photoshop anymore except their super rich nich businesses that already havent moved on to other technology.  Thats the vibe I get. Autodesk was something of a community of free users improving their help and tutorials and user interface. Everyone knew what autodesk was even if you never used its software.  They will go 100% cloud and be premium for a insane priceing stradegy only to attract the richest of the rich customers all while making their name on the free version no longer offered.

But now running lightburn on my daughter’s pc it is working great. Much more powerful /fast/capable than my glowforge plus and wow for the price.

Prior to buying my 50w Omtech, I rented a Glowforge from a friend, and it was 100% unusable because you HAVE TO scan the bed with the camera prior to every burn. So, if you think you’re going to design something and pound a bunch of them out, 1 after the other, you’re going to be seriously disappointed. It makes no difference that every piece is on exactly the same material and there is no need to scan every time. You HAVE TO. Their software is crap and replacement parts are more trouble than their worth.  I had a Lightburn camera on my Omtech. I took it out and threw it away. I can’t imagine what could possibly be the use for something so wildly inaccurate, and that’s after having spent far too much time mastering the calibration procedure. I’d disagree with the statement that Omtech support is great. It’s not. I had an issue with a loose X axis belt. I spent several days going back and forth with them and their suggestions for what to do had nothing - literally zero - to do with the problem, which was a loose belt. I figured it out on my own. Aside from that, I’ve been VERY happy with the machine and I’m coming up on a year of using it for production manufacturing.","@michaelkeymont501","2022-11-23T16:47:05",1,0

"Ugw3R2I_VobLvTMqBHd4AaABAg","6 Mistakes Not to Make When Building a Farmhouse Table","1:25 and even if you don't have a table saw you can just plane it by hand. No need to buy all kinds of powertools. 1:55 dowels are optional. They can help against slippage while gluing, maybe even make the joints marginally stronger, but you don't actually need them. 2:20 this is actually nonsense. If you alternate the directions you're going to get a wavy surface. You're averaging out the warping, but not stopping the warping. If you keep them all in one direction and make sure it wants to bow in an upward arch, if you then fasten the middle securely the entire rail the top rests on will stop it from warping altogether (that is, unless there's so much force the fastening doesn't hold, but you shouldn't get such moisture extremes indoors). 40:20 you did the breadboard wrong. In the board itself you can just drill holes, but the part it slides over can only have a normal drill hole in the middle (to keep the breadboard centered). The other holes need to be elongated slots rather than just holes, so the pins going through them have room to move sideways (but not length wise obviously). Just a few millimeters, but what you've done now is basically the same as screwing the board on. This creates stress. Also, there's no need to glue it in the middle. You can, but you should glue less wide than you did. Just a bit around the centre pin.  4:20 yup, you need to practice planing. Especially sharpening your plane. Make it sharp, slightly round the corners, use a shallow setting, work methodically, and you won't have marks. Also, you need to check whether the sole of your plane is flat.   Good on you for keeping practicing and wanting to learn!","@nagranoth_","2022-10-10T13:43:48",0,0

Then make a block that height--in my case, I 3D printed a simple rectangular block, was able to get within 0.05mm of the desired height, I think.  Then, if you want to etch, place your block on top of the etching surface, and let the laser module rest on the block while tightening.  If you want to burn, set your block on the empty honeycomb (or whatever sacrificial surface), and let the module rest on the block while tightening--remove the block and insert your material to burn.

If the mill is chocking up use an end mill with more flutes or a higher rotation speed. Also you need mills with cutting geometry specifically for soft metals like aluminium and brass on low powered machines like this. If you had tried this with brass it would have probably given even worse results because brass is so soft it tends to grab the cutter so definitely needs correct end mills with the correct geometry. Also a shorter end mill will help and repositioning the spindle higher up in the mount will produce less stresses in the z axis and gantry assemblies.","@schrodingerscat1863","2022-09-14T18:04:20",10,1

"UgzU56q1wnHvZncAsvJ4AaABAg","What Can a $500 CNC Do? Genmitsu 3020 Pro Max","I bought this 3020 in Nov 2021 strictly for aluminum cutting. I’ve been using a competitors machine for over a decade and it works great. I was disappointed with this machine and had several issues. It will cut aluminum but not not very well. The 1/8” bit must be all the way in the shaft. (And to prevent milling the table it’s best to lower the Z axis to the lowest point and raise the spindle in the holder so the bit can’t reach the table.) But the spindle is just not rigid enough to handle the cutting, the length of the shaft allows slight flexing. And the spindle doesn’t have enough speed or torque. I found that even slowly cutting a 1” hole in 2mm aluminum with 9 passes was nail biting. It did cut the hole but was a struggle. The finished hole was a few thousands under size because the spindle rigidity was causing it to flex inward. And just drilling a 1/8” hole w the milling bit would sputter when reaching the bottom, and wallowed the hole almost every time. So to fix both issues I hack sawed the spindle holder (another problem-only a 55mm spindle fits), and mounted a $70 rotozip (600W 30K RPM) with metal strapping. Now it mills, drills, and cuts much better. Note that after less than 10 hours the 300W spindle stopped working.  The other issue I had was that most all of the USB software I tried wouldn’t run a few commands of my existing gcode. Also, it was essential that I could stop and start the gcode from any gcode line, and couldn’t do it! So, to get around those problems I abandoned the USB controller and bought a parallel stepper driver and use LinuxCNC (or Mach2).  Overall it’s a nice little machine but wouldn’t recommend for aluminum unless your into mods.","@engineeringfun8542","2022-09-12T12:52:00",9,3

After watching every review I could find and then reading purchased reviews I decided that the Ortur was the way to go for me. First, the performance seemed to be slightly better when engraving and second but more importantly were the customer service oriented ratings. There seemed to be a trend towards a lack of customer service with xTool lately. I know there is a lot of turmoil going on in China right now so this is probably a temporary thing. Lastly, Amazon had a flash sale on the LM3 the other day making it $595 so I jumped on it. That left more money for accessories which we'll need to run these at there best. Just my 2 cents...

"Ugxl0PwBm5x4P2C3XMF4AaABAg","Top Laser Engravers and Cutters to Get in 2022","Engraving DPI is hugely important.  While I know 1200 DPI on a diode or fiber is doable, they are mainly marking machines (not cutting).  When I compared machines, I asked specifically about DPI ... they all report higher numbers than to be expected AND/or skipped around an answer ... their website numbers cannot be trusted.  The newer gen. machines have better motors than the 4+ yr old designs and can consistently do +800dpi, like the 2 co2 machines you mentioned.  There are more economy options that can perform, and there are more DIY coolers that aren't messy nor expensive.  I have a BOSS 70W and can cut/engrave basically anything I desire.  but it's older and doesn't have the newer motors (so the effective DPI is about 1/2 of the newer machines with the smallest focal lens), but it can be upgraded.  If it's a hobby, speed isn't as important ... precision is.  i would never spend less than $3k on any laser, period.  People ask when i give them stuff i make: "" You did what?""  i say:""yes, I'm a Jedi, I cut stuff with light"".  Diodes imo don't count.  I've used over 36 types of materials .. and my co2 hasn't failed me yet.","@patrickmcginnis7","2022-08-24T04:17:06",1,0

"Ugxq3U1BCb5yveXNgil4AaABAg","Better and Cheaper than Glowforge?  Gweike Cloud Laser Review","If you're spending 4-7 grand on a machine, the learning curve is insignificant.  Once you've learnt it, you don't keep learning it.  What does matter, is the day to day experience of using it once you've climbed that curve.  For example. I have a great bean-to-cup coffee machine.  It makes great coffee, and I can tweak it to my heart's content, even though it's a clunky interface.  What is unforgiveable, is that every single time I turn it on, I have to wait for it to go through a cleaning cycle.  I can't put my cup under the brew head until it's finished, or it will fill with dirty water, so I can't just press a button and let it do its stuff.  Before it turns off, it cleans itself again.  It cleans itself so often, I have to refill the water really often, and empty the drip tray just as often.  I have another, much less fancy, less refined machine that I bought when the other broke down.  I can press the power button, and twenty seconds later press the button to brew the coffee, and a minute later I'm drinking espresso.  It's not quite as good at making my perfect coffee, but it's pretty good, it's harder to dial it in, it's noisier, and nothing like as polished, but in daily use it's so much more user friendly that I prefer it to my other machine. For laser cutters, if you have to spend a couple of minutes getting the focus just right, or you need several trial runs to set the power/speed for each job, it doesn't matter how easy to learn it is, it's going to get tiresome pretty quickly.  Another machine might be hard to learn at first, you might need to build up a database of materials and power/speeds, but if, after doing that, all you have to do is insert the stock and press start, and know that it'll do the same good job every time, that machine will win every time.","@Raven-Creations","2022-08-23T01:46:47",2,0

They're selling goods not produced yet...  It all ended up costing me much, much more.  Not to mention all the wasted time arguing with them...","@EspenStabforsmo","2022-08-17T14:07:52",0,0
"Ugwjw-J0b8RxIfZNZjN4AaABAg","Better and Cheaper than Glowforge?  Gweike Cloud Laser Review","This long comment is in no way criticising  this video. It is ,hopefully, adding more techincal colour to this already informative video.   Any 50 watt tube will be 1000mmm long and 50mm diameter. 50 watts is the max power test spec. NOT what you can use. This will be an 800mm long 40 watt tube  that will fit iinsde the 970mm wide case. 50 watts is marketeing speak. There are major issues with fume extraction and Gweike have issued a couple of upgrades (check out their videos). You need air FLOW through the  machine to extract fumes. You cannot get FLOW through a closed box like the Glowforge and the little grill on the Gweike is an inadequate  concession to this requirement of physics.  600mm/s is a meaningless marketing spec if you dont have the power to damnage material at that speed . Every different type of wood or material has a different damage threshold so the MDF used in this test  requires a critical level light  INTENSITY for a certain EXPOSURE time to damage it. The fixed INTENSITY of a candle flame will damage your hand if you pass it through the flame slow enough.......that demonstates what exposure time means... That is the whole  principle of engraving. The Gweike  has a typical 2"" lens but you can make the candle beam more intense  because Gweike supply a shorter 1.5"" lens. and that means faster engraving .....but poorer cutting. Not an option on the Glowforge.    The overtavel at the end of each scan depende on the speed you choose to scan at. If you decide to run at 300mm/s (as per the video)  then the overtravel  is a fixed non-engraving event.  In this case the Gweike  is running at 250dpi so there are also 250 scans  per inch of image that is 500 non-engraving events per inch. The Glowforge has 450 non engraving events per inch. So there is MORE wasted time on the Gweike but it still engraves quicker becuse of its shorter overtravel (faster acceleration.)  Because the Gweike machine can run with the native Ruida software (RDWorks) or Lightburn. you have the opportunity to crank up the acceleration (software controlled) and make the Gweike run light years faster than the  ""you cant touch anything"" Glowforge.  Speed is meaningless for cutting, it always has to be done slowly, maybe 10 to 20mm/s would be typical  depending on material and thickness.. Neither machine is setup with  a cutting  configuration where the nozzle would  be close to the work. Thus any air assist is only protecting the lens and not making cutting more efficient. These are essentially engraving machines that can cut inefficiently.  Look at all the brown fume depositions around the cuts., that means  air  assist will do a great job of painting your engravings with this tarry residue.     Cutting should always be done with a single pass, which CO2 lasers can do easily because they operae on a totally different wavelength to diode laserswhich for many physics reasons are very inefficient at cutting and require multiple passes.   Auto focus is a big problem. A lens will be sold with a fixed focal length. But that focal length does NOT apply to lasers.That lens will work as specified if you put it into a telescope or camera where you are focusing an IMAGE with normal random non-coherent light. A laser beam si totally different and there is no IMAGING involved .  the aim is to focus light INTENSITY. If you focus a lens to cut efficiently at 10mm/s  it is certain that the best focal distance will be at least 1mm different to the manufacturer's fixed focus. Now try engraving at 400mm/s and the best focus (thinnest line) will be 2 or 3mm different.. The best focus also depends on the material being used. So power, speed and material can all affect the optimal INTENSITY focal point. So how can auto focus take all these factors into account? Thus the less sophisticated motor driven (software controlled) focus of the Gweike allows you to take thes various parameters into account  and lets YOU select the best focus  when you understand a bit more about the peculiarities of laser technology.  $50/month to ACCESS a machine that you may have already paid $5000 for  seems  scam that no one would ever fall for.   Hmmmm.  Ease of use?. I can remember when I was 5,  I probably had little or no technical ability. This machine would have been a great techno toy where I could make things happen with little or no knowledge of the technology. As a 5 year old it would have still required my dad to set it up before I could ""play"" with it.. This is a well presented video  but he and I  cant unlearn knowledge,  so making a  ""an ease of use"" judgment is very difficult. Where is the baseline?  As a business machine for making money the Gwieke wins hands down. Its faster (and, with knowledge, can be made even faster),  greater flexibility, much lower price. no forced rental of software and  no need for an internet connection. It also allows you to make mistakes and learn about laser technology in the process, so that  you are prepared for your jump up to a bigger more powerful machine.  Glowforge is a closed box where you have purposely been excluded from learning about laser technology. Its a great business model .   Final technical note. 100%power ?  The tube %power is not really watts. This is glass tube technology and the tube manufacturer specifies the safe  MAXIMUM current allowed to flow through the tube. The tube watts is determined by the current flow. For a 40 watt tube  the max RUNNING current you can use will be 18mA for a 40 watt tube and  19mA for a 45 watt tube (Do I believe Glowforge is 45 watts?  Note the tube dimensions and check on any tube manufacturers website). It is possible to set the high voltage power supply so that 100%power  does not exceed  these limits. This  protects the tube and give it 4 years or more life. I belive the Gweike has an ammeter fitted that allows you to check this.  Glowforge?  I think not.   Exceeding these limits through lack of knowledge  could be expensive and ruin your tube within a year. The mA current flow and watts output are not related linearly   so for example  for your 18mA  max current you will get 40 watts output  but at 1/3 of the current flow (6ma) you will be expecting 33%power ie13 watts.  Sadly no,  because the relationship is non-linear you will probably be delivering 20 or evern 25 watts. The % power applies to current flow through your tube and NOT watts.   50% power is not 20 watts.","@SarbarMultimedia","2022-08-17T13:25:49",3,1

Luckily 90% of our products are flat acrylic, smaller pieces that the Glowforge can handle easily so as far as ease of use goes, we just keep at least two of them cranking out products daily.  We do love Lightburn when it comes to the larger 150W CO2 we use for our big stuff, rotary, etc. as well as our new Fiber laser (thank god for Lightburn Galvo) so we can see how both situations bring value to your business.  Being an early Glowforge adopter, we paid half the price for both of our Basics and our Pro, so I'm not sure if I would choose Glowforge now at their current price point, but I really do love the cameras, auto-focus, and small footprint.

"Ugx6DzUzyjs0Ra1_KZx4AaABAg","Better and Cheaper than Glowforge?  Gweike Cloud Laser Review","By not including much about the pass through you are missing most of what makes the Glowforge pro better. Otherwise your G-machine is far more comparable to the Glowforge machines in the same price bracket. Instead of he 14 inch height of the G-machine the Pro can use material as big as you can fit in the house, not only for large projects but I buy my material 48"" long and use as much as I need  Yes the 40 watt machines are rated at less power, but Glowforge does not ""overclock""their machines so they last longer than if they run at max power. As for premium, if someone is trying to make money right away premium  opens up thousands of free designs that they can legally sell right away so if you have a market. If you want to design in Inkscape you have less of an incentive, but I still find many conveniences that I  use instead of going back to Inkscape or Gimp and reloading. With the many free designs ( full disclosure a few of mine as well) there is also access to the entire Noun Project that does not allow commercial use of their designs, but Glowforge worked out a deal and they get some of that premium fee also. So if you do not want to learn Inkscape, Gimp or many of the more pricey options. The Glowforge app is av pretty good design tool that you can even use on your tablet or phone.   On another point, once the cur is loaded on to the machine there is no internet needed, so if the internet goes out while it is cutting it will not affect the machine. Unfortunately you cannot keep running that file again, though many have suggested it. Which brings up another point. There is a great deal of hands on connection that takes place over time. There are many complaints that connecting to support is more time consuming  than they like, but the volume is huge and it may take a bit, but the final result is far better than my abilities to interact with any other company.","@freedem41","2022-07-31T03:31:03",0,1

I rep the GC hard whenever someone wants a desktop class laser.   Dumped my prior Atomstack X7. Did not get the GF due to 1. closed system in both software and hardware and 2. price. If anyone is looking for other users of the GC, their facebook group(s) is your best place. They have like 3 facebook groups and it is confusing but join them all. You will find me and many others on there who love the GC.  comments to the video: -gweikeclouds hinges are horrible unless you open it all the way (not sure how the GF is). better if the hinges hold at any angle.  -passthrough is easy. just stick a magnet or something metal where the sensor is. but unfortunately fumes will escape. -air compressor indeed is external on the GC but that means you can swap it to whatever you want. on GF its not upgradeable.  And yes, a big con is gweikes marketing. case and point you mention ""autofocus."" something is lost in translation there. They also make this mistake marketing the air assist. Heck a big con is indeed this overseas translation thing. While tech support is VERY responsive (you get assigned to like 7 tech people through an app after the purchase of the machine) sometimes small details can be lost in translation. Is that worth paying the thousands for a GF over the GC? nah. its not THAT bad but just a heads up from me to whoever looking to buy a GC.  Also i should mention for cost of the GC, it CAN get even cheaper as Gweike runs events here and there where you can get cash that brings down your initial purchase cost.","@GuyWithAGweikeCloud","2022-07-29T18:04:37",3,4

"Ugym71qi91BA2MWrwQV4AaABAg","What Can a $500 CNC Do? Genmitsu 3020 Pro Max","This was a very helpful video!  I would love to ask you what is the machine that you would get, similar travels on the axes with more on the z if possible, that can mill aluminum without serious compromise.    Since aluminum likes to mess with us with it being gummy let's machine the gummiest aluminum - is that 6061 - if not please just specify and let's make say a motor mount plate.  So a square shape, say 3""x3"" by 3/8 or 1/2"" when finished with a bunch of holes punched through for through bolts, some holes to be tapped,   Lets also mill a pattern into the face of this square of aluminum that is say a 2"" square shape that is 1/4"" wide square track that we are ending with. The feature is also a finished depth of 1/4"".    So if we are using proper feeds and speeds from the machinists handbook or other proper sources what is the most depth we can take on each pass say even on your typical industrial heavy duty vertical milling machine.  That sets our target or best possible case, then can you answer in your opinion which brand machine in these low dollar tiers do you think can actually come close to this level of performance.  Last but not least this machine needs to be capable of true 3d milling into aluminum. Lets say we are going to mill a ball shape where we have a semi-circle full round shape the diameter of the circle is 3"" and the height at the center of the shape is also 3"" - so we are getting what would look like a bandsaw slice through part of a pool ball cut in half,   Which machine can get great surface finishes and also do the work in a reasonable amount of time.  I am assuming that if a machine could make this 3d feature then it could likely make most features that i would ever need it to.  Please let me know if this is a poor assumption.   This whole CNC market has so many machines that could never hope to do this work which is fairly basic work for sure.  And I know that this was a little bit to read but I am hoping those of you with knowledge and experience will simply be able to just snap your fingers and say - yea, get a ""THIS BRAND"" and get ""MODEL ABC123"", they are great!    Oh damn, we can't forget about cost, I would ask 2 things for cost.  1 - can you do this for under $1000?  How about for under $800 and wow if we can you can do this for $500.

If the work area on the lc-40 was the same as Xtool d1 or larger & it had a 10 or 20w laser option, it would be the far superior machine. For ENGRAVING, genmitsu jensoku lc-40 is superior. I want to cut thin wood & use rotary, though. So I was forced to by d1 pro 10w since 20w is way too expensive right now. Speed trade off, right? If lc-40 had 10 or 20w, I definitely would have bought that. If I was ONLY engraving, it would be the best laser for that, hands down. Build is just that much better.

This diode laser with a cutting base option and box to stop the house from burning down while catching the fumes is $100 / watt.

It's turning out to be invaluable, especially for prototyping. I can cut out pattern pieces of full grain leather with the knife without burning any edges, then laser engrave, all in one go. Originally, the 45-degree blades that came with the box were not able to cut through my 1.2mm veg tan, but I saw that after product launch, they released a 60-degree blade. Shipping was going to make those blades extremely expensive, so I took a risk, ran to Hobby Lobby, and bought Cricut Deep Cut blades to see if they work. They do!! Pretty sure they're the exact same blade as what xTool is selling. I would love if the Cricut knife blade would also work with the M1, but it seems more proprietary. Maybe xTool will make one.

"UgxIFGZ3x34Yd-JHNBx4AaABAg","It's 48x FASTER than a Diode Laser! 3PLASERS EM-Smart 20W MOPA Laser Review","Since MOPA is better for plastics, I'm curious how well a small, simple machine like this would do with PCB prototyping or small scale manufacturing. It wouldn't be too difficult to have a multi-material profile, just switch frequency and amplitude within a certain set of lines in the code. 'Etching' a PCB would be such a great alternative to the typical developing methods, as even some of the newer prototyping methods, like using a photoresist PCB blank on the LCD of an MSLA printer, still require developing in chemicals. If this could not only etch the traces, but also etch the board for proper marking, I don't see why this couldn't be a viable alternative to cheap board manufacturing. Stemming from this, I'm curious how well this kind of laser handles various solder masks, say if someone wanted to mask a whole board then etch the masking off the pads, instead of more typical processes; most PCB software already separate pads and traces, so technically you'd already have a file for just pads, with the proper settings you could potentially etch the solder mask but not the copper pad underneath.   If it works out, something like this could be great for maker spaces, assuming someone had already gone through the calibrations for specific materials, thicknesses, etc. Even as a hobbyist or small business, a machine like this would be amazing for prototyping and small production runs.","@xaytana","2022-06-19T07:00:06",3,0

Does the atomstack have metal rollers etc like the Xtool or is that part of the quality difference between the two? Also does the 20w head weigh much more than the 10w, just thinking about wear and tear or stability of the head at speed etc?

The xTool D1 Review","I reached out to Xtool customer support for a D1 & accessories since I wanted to figure out if I need to pay import duty & VAT.   They don't seem to be serious about EU law. No clarity on where they ship from. As an EU citizen, I have the right to know.   As per EU Standard, the seller needs to tell the customer where its dispatched when placing an order, VAT, etc. If I ask about VAT, the Xtool customer support personnel is giving an inclusive response.  What I understood is partly they want to ship from the EU & partly from outside the EU.   There is a tax obligation, depending on where they fulfill from. This needs to be clear when placing the order, if they ship from the EU, they pay VAT in one of the EU countries where you ship from. Otherwise, it's an export order, either they pay if you have IOSS registration or I need to pay on import extra cost to me.   You are mixing up, and dogging after the initial response.  Maybe Xtool is good, but not possible to buy from with in EU.  After a week of chatting with them, now I am looking into some other brand.","@Rama-ei1yb","2022-06-16T13:40:56",0,0

"UgzoH0zvEPph1f1C9AN4AaABAg","The Best Laser Cutter for any Budget?","Interesting video, thanks for sharing your thoughts on lasers. I'm very surprised you picked Glowforge above all other desktop lasers.   Having used both the Glowforge and others, the only benefit to Glowforge is ease of getting started.  The native Glowforge software is a bit easier to use, but it is also feature poor. They also hobble the software unless you pay a monthly subscription fee.   Other drawbacks include - cleaning the Glowforge is more difficult, and the laser is underpowered for the price. Most importantly, and most hidden from the customer, - their support is weak at best; they are slow to respond to issues, if they ever do; and they don't really sell key replacement parts for wear and tear, instead they want you to ship your machine back and purchase a refurbished device for all but the smallest issues.   Oh, and  you have to upload your designs to their cloud based service, meaning you can't print if your internet is offline and they can monitor what you print on your machine.","@Walsfeo","2022-06-07T11:28:12",10,0

Which machine would you recommend or such a job?  knowing that the CO2 lasers are deemed a bit too expensive and too small for that use.

"UgzBNjK3WF0YnB5y3hF4AaABAg","Is this feature worth $2400?  The Snapmaker 2.0 Rotary","10:18  Yeah, Enclosure (Which imo is kind of required for the laser) + Rotary + Main Machine is quite expensive.  I don’t know where i stand on it.  From what I’ve seen it’s a good machine.  I also love the modular design, and sealed parts with rugged cables.  My main complaint is that it’s not open source, granted they have fears of copycats i guess?  Maybe they could do something like open source the last generation each time they make a new one?  I’m excited to see the one in it’s printing, because a locked down extruder/nozzle ecosystem is a concern i have not knowing much about this.  Also selling “toolplates” so you could make a drag knife (or knife + servos for turning with the cut), or marker, or even EDM module would be really cool.  I think one channel has made their own pen  holder for the snapmaker.  Open Sourcing the standard could help toolhead development too.  I guess in conclusion if they could open source it, and/or get the cost of the rotary+enclosure+machine down to maybe 1,000-1,500 USD or so it would be top tier of “first 3d printer” category, not just “best all in one machine”!

"Ugys3sYgMLb5nIDOWiN4AaABAg","The Most Powerful Laser Diode? NEJE Master 2S Plus A40640 Laser","""15 watt"" laser? This is true. The laser manufacturers are taking the idea of running electronics at a lower power to lengthen their lives. GE used to do that with incandescent lifebulbs - they would manufacture the bulbs to run at 130v AC so that when we used them at normal household voltage (110-120) the bulbs would last a lot longer than typical bulbs. So NEJE is doing the same with their modules - building them with 15 watt, but driving them to produce 10.5 -11 watt output. So even if you run them at 100% for long projects, the laser will still continue to produce full power and have a decent lifespan. I have been reading how a few laser users are finding out that their lesser well-designed lasers would die soon after a project that required their lasers to run at 100% for an extended period of time. This is why NEJE, Atomstack and  other laser manufacturers are doing this ""underpowering"" their laser modules to extend their lives. They use 7.5 watt laser diodes and only force them to deliver 5 Watts. The dual diodes are 7.5 diodes x2, each powered to produce about 5.5 Watts each to result in a 10-12 watt laser, depending on the manufacturer. These NEW modules are typically rated with 20, 000 hour life spans.","@Animalwon","2022-04-21T06:44:23",0,0

I’ve found it to be a way better printer than my Ender 3 V2, easy to set up, easy to calibrate and much more even bed heating. I’ve found it way easier to get consistent layering and I haven’t had a print come loose yet. Once you get the work flow down swapping between modes is about 5 minutes work. Laser works well for engraving and cuts 2mm birch,  it it’s slow. Luban works well very well if you’re just doing something straight forward.   My assessment, it’s much easier to get started, get making and get consistent results with this than my Ender. I enjoy using the snapmaker and feel like I get to focus on the project not the machine. My first month with the ender was an endless series of failed prints, great learning experience but at times quite discouraging. First time I booted up the SM, it auto calibrated, I dropped the print head 0.5mm, hit print and got a perfect print of a model I was still failing to get on the Ender after a half dozen attempts.

Would have saved me a lot of time and money.   So within a week of opening the machine, I reached out to Snapmaker for support concerning the laser function. Turns out the guy I got stuck with didn't know what he was talking about. He told me it was broken, and I was then jacked around for 3 months before they stopped replying at all. 3 months later (6 months in total) They reach back out to me concerning a negative review I left on a third party site.  I used their contact to start trying to get help from them again, only to find out the problem I originally had is a limitation of the machine itself. Camera capture cannot accurately capture tall items  (3-4"" tall) for engraving. It just cuts out massive sections of the image. So 6 months, countless hours of time, and countless materials wasted trying to fix a machine that they said was broken... that wasn't.   They also removed my negative review from their site, and tried to bribe me into taking down my third party site review.   I did end up getting a 50% refund, but that was because I was prepared to dispute the charges with Paypal. It's an ok, non upgradeable 3D printer. It's not a Prusa, or even an Ender. Haven't had a chance to play with the CNC yet, as the machine is noisy enough on its own.   My review stands, and I'll continue to tell everyone about my experiences.

"Ugx-qazkug9jEVl7ahN4AaABAg","The Most Powerful Laser Diode? NEJE Master 2S Plus A40640 Laser","Hi Brandon, I recently picked up the Neje A40640 and have been working on calibrating it for a few weeks - I'm a total n00b and really appreciate your videos!  When digging a bit deeper into the reference documentation - I noticed that this module has a variable focal distance - the lens actually rotates. In the Neje wiki documentation I've found that they recommend setting it at a focal distance of about 33mm for engraving and about 55mm for cutting (18mm ply?!?).  You have to unscrew the lens about 7 full rotations from it's fully 'closed' or seated position against the upper housing for engraving but it definitely produces a finer spot.   My USB microscope doesn't have a measurement tool but from my very rough estimate, it looks like I can get a line width of around .12 when setup for the 'engraving'  focal distance.  I'm sure folks would appreciate your more seasoned look at it - especially as you call it out as having a bigger dot width, which may not be entirely accurate given the configuration options.   I hope this observation comes across in the most positive light,  I really appreciate all videos and your calibration methods - super helpful for someone new to the technology! Keep up the great work!!","@JeffBarrows","2022-04-06T00:16:17",3,1

These diode laser are great TOYS yes toys... they are great sweet toys to learn laser cutting to use Lightburn but they are absolutely unusable to anything serious. After half year I bought a 50W CO2 laser and the difference is DAY and NIGHT. If you want to cut out anything complicated with a diode laser you have to wait 2-3 hours... the CO2 is exactly 10X faster which is a LOT. Without air assist and what is even more important without smoke sucking!!!!  People cannot imagine how much smoke these machines generate, you cannot stay in the same room if you are cutting wood or plastic for longer times..... Soo please people don't believe anybody if you really want to cut than save up for a CO2 machine. (Yes I know it cost 6-7X more but it worth it) These diode lasers are a waist of money... and no they will not be stronger the two diode versions are quite expensive with 10W makes the CO2 almost cheap. Only one thing which is slightly better with the diode laser is the the kerf (cutting width) is slightly smaller (but also not circular but like rectangle). Think long term go with CO2...","@rockjano","2022-04-01T12:21:15",0,0

"Ugz1FiO3doT2er_QqIx4AaABAg","Testing the OM Tech K40 Laser","Just FYI. Don't run the ground lug to a different ground than what your source of power is using, it is dangerous.  NEC wants an effective ground fault path for ground faults, the Dirt or a rod in the Dirt is not an effective ground fault path.   An example would be if the metal frame became energized, the dirt has too high of resistance to return the voltage to it's source, in this scenario you would get shocked if you touched it.  A rod in the dirt is only good at discharging static or lightning.  That is why the ground is tied to the neutral in your electrical panel.  If the case becomes energized it will take the path of least resistance back to source through the ground wire which would cause the circuit breaker to become overloaded and open.  That's how the ground wire works. It's an effective ground fault path back to the  source, utility. Static and lightning discharging back it's source, Earth through the ground rod.

"Ugy6evbktkGp3ZXN_nB4AaABAg","The Best Laser Cutter for any Budget?","Good and informative review. Thank you! Just one question.. With CO2-lasers the air assist near or on the nossle is for clearing the smoke and fumes, so the beam is unobstructed for a sharper, better result and the focusing lens gets less wear due to particles sticking to it and burning in. In the video you mention air assist, or lack thereof, on diode lasers, but as a lacking safety feature for putting out fires.. Is the use of air assis that different in the two types? In my experience the air assist can promote the opposite, as it fans any fire, adding more oxygen.","@tacmonkey","2022-02-22T22:51:53",3,0

"UgzAEjrPdrxAUkEpqj94AaABAg","The Best Laser Cutter for any Budget?","Hi Brandon, I have to say, you are the only person that I watch when it comes to laser talk. Though I know nothing of the machines and most of what you speak of is a foreign language to me, I enjoy watching them all the same. With that being said,  I am seriously in need of suggestions because I have absolutely no idea what I need to purchase, especially since I have never laid eyes on a laser/engraver in my life. Whichever one I purchase will be going inside my craft room in my house. The room is 25 ft long X 13.5 wide so space is not an issue, however, the entrance to my house is only 34” wide, so it would have to be small enough to go through the entrance. In no particular order, these are the things that I would love to learn to create… Jewelry pieces (namely earrings) from wood, leather, and acrylic. I’d like to be able to cut out the wood to assemble jewelry boxes, shadow boxes, keepsake boxes, small-medium-sized desk organizers, and similar items. I would also like to be able to learn how to make round door signs (at least 15”), 3D layered designs and other wall decorative items. I would love to be able to learn how to engrave on leather and acrylic, books, personalize journals, wallets, and a few other items. I am not new to crafting, just new to laser cutting/engraving. I would greatly appreciate all suggestions that could help me make my final decision as well as any other equipment that could help make things run smoother and of course, the more budget-friendly it is, the better.","@sandrawalters","2022-02-04T05:27:38",0,0

Considering these Chinese lasers are always 10w under the stated rating, you are ending up with 20w of cutting power.

"Ugxoo2Fza5eqtsnBcOV4AaABAg","Fusion 360 - Did Autodesk just kill the FREE Version?","I think the changes are a big negative for hobby users or those teaching themselves or in the pre-start-up phase.  They made 3 axis projects take a lot longer by removing rapids. A 3-hour project will now take 12 hours which is huge if you have to stand watching the machine (as most hobby users do). Not to mention the extra power usage...  They made 4 and 5 axis hobby cnc machines useless by removing that functionality completely. This limits what you can make regardless if it's a one-off hobby job or full production.   Manual tool changes have been made needlessly arduous as they now require a whole new operation.  They could have achieved the stated goal by simply limiting the hobby version to only posting to Mach 3 and Linuxcnc which no commercial VMCs use.   Most of what they removed has nothing to do with commercial operations. It looks more aimed at forcing hobby users to pay for expensive subscriptions for the small handful of personal projects they do.","@Zebra66","2022-01-04T20:18:11",2,0

I don’t want to buy one only to realize I need a bigger one etc. I also don’t want to buy industrial only to get bored with producing products. I don’t mind spending 20-25K setting up shop with tools that I will need to do the work correctly. I do have a bunch of carpenter tools for rough work but nothing really for finish work.

I don’t know. I want to check out your other reviews as well as other folks reviews on the different brands. I will also be looking if someone did a video on complete tools to setup a shop needed.

As recently as 9 months ago, xTool was heavily promoting their D1 and D1 Pro lasers, yet if one visits their site now, ALL of the replacement parts are ""out of stock"", and none of the laser heads can be replaced, with the exception of the $1,200 40w head for the D1 Pro.  So if your machine breaks, be aware you cannot get parts to repair it. This seems to be true for all xTool products, and I think a 2 year (maximum) service life is preposterous for a tool at this price-point.","@Metal_Vistas","2023-12-22T18:15:04",0,0

Would a 40W diode laser with a 5.5W optical output do that in 1 - 2 passes or would I need to go up to 80W or something else? I have more time than money so speed isn't as big a factor. The mechanical  portion is the least cost and problem. I have a machining background as well as machine tools to build the mechanics. The most difficult part for me is choosing a decent module that won't hurt the bank to much.","@Neptune730","2023-10-23T01:42:43",0,3
"UgxaORbrPfbhupvStVd4AaABAg","Laser Companies are Lying to You","I find it crazy that people buy into the unshielded lasers expecting anything good to come of it. The only laser cutter/engraver I have experience with was a massive unit with full shielding and multiple warning stickers about the dangers of laser radiation. These unshielded units are either not powerful enough to do what they advertise, or they are dangerously leaking radiation into your surroundings and you should probably discontinue using it. Generally, a laser above 5mw is enough to cause eye damage if directly shone into your eyes, and lasers above around the 250mw range can cause temporary eye damage indirectly in large exposure. Above 500mw, the damage is permanant.   These units are often claiming their lasers are ""40W"", which is 80 times the limit for permanent eye damage. This makes the lasers about 9 times more dangerous to handle for the end user. At this level, indirectly viewing the beam or the landing point of the beam will damage your eyes, likely permanantly. The wave length of the laser doesn't change much about the danger to your eye sight, as even undetectable in the UV and IR wave lengths will blind you. Non-visable-light-based lasers (say that 5 times fast) are often more dangerous as you don't even have any reflexes to mitigate the damage. Visable light lasers will cause your eye to reflexively close, which limits the exposure time and chance of blindness. IR and UV wavelengths don't trigger this response, so you won't know anything is wrong until your eye starts hurting which means the exposure time is already exceeding three times the normal amount for visable light, if not more so. Don't cheap out on laser tech, it's dangerous.","@Handles_AreStupid","2023-10-22T14:51:43",1,0

So to replace your tube cost you a few thousand dollars, or a bearing, or any other part you can't get from somewhere else.  2. One thing I that wasn't clear in the ""Connectivity"" section, which machines force you to be connected to their cloud before they let you use it?  That is a HUGE deal breaker for me.  If the internet, or your router, or their server, is down so is your laser???  Not going to happen.    If a company has that much control over whether or not you can use your machine that will eventually come around to screw you, guaranteed.  At some point that company is going to want you to pay for it's cloud, meaning a new monthly subscription service.  At any time that company could go out of business making your laser a super expensive paper weight.

The reason is because glowforge does not run gcode, it does not and cannot accept gcode, so it's impossible for any software to interface with it.  Everything has to go through their website.  Also you have to pay a monthly fee to do anything but the very basics with their software.  If you want to cut a square, for example, through their software, that is considered a premium feature and you have to pay for that feature.  But glowforge does do passthrough nicely. Also glowforge has some nice features that you've missed.  For example it detects if you cut anything that will create poison gas that will kill you.  An absolute must if you're going to put this in a classroom where a kid might be vinyl in the machine. That feature alone would make the glowforge the only option for many IMHO.","@johnflux1","2023-10-09T23:20:50",0,0

If you think you are going to laser some cool images on a piece of wood and ever get your money back...think again.  Every Tom, Dick, and Harry is out there trying to do the same exact thing.  The cheaper the entry level into business (and 5K is beyond cheap) the more people are going to be in your space and for that reason...you should really have an idea of how you are going to make a profit BEFORE you buy the laser.  This is way more important than the price differences between the laser.  You can come back from spending to much if you have a great idea.

The factor that you didn't mention at all is likely the biggest factor to consider when making this decision... Serviceability.   While the K40 is obviously repairable, since it can be upgraded, it's my understanding that the Glowforge is not serviceable at all.    Last year I was considering buying a used Glowforge and found dozens for sale.  Thinking that anything bought used would likely at least need a new tube I looked into the cost of parts and the tube.  Turns out you can't buy parts or repair the machine on your own.  If your tube, or any other part, goes out then the only option is to ship the machine back to Glowforge and they will give you a discount on buying a new one.  I couldn't find any other service information so I opted to not get one.    It's a truly  horrible policy that makes the Glowforge seem more like a scam than a ligament machine.

Ortur issues  info below:  Well-Known Issues with Ortur Lasermaster 3: A Comprehensive Review  Issue 1: Ortur LM-3 Not Powering On One of the most prevalent problems encountered by users of the Ortur Laser Master 3 is its failure to power on. This issue can stem from various factors, including a faulty power adapter, blown fuse, loose connections, malfunctioning laser module, or motherboard glitches. Notably, the Ortur LM-3 has faced criticism for having an underpowered ""power brick."" Despite seeking assistance for this issue, my attempts were met with silence. Subsequently, I discovered a suitable replacement on Amazon.  Issue 2: Inadequate Laser Engraving When laser engravings fail to meet expectations, several causes might be at play. These include improper focus, uneven engraving area, or unsuitable materials for engraving.  Issue 3: Mid-Operation Halts Frequent occurrences of the machine halting during operations can be attributed to loose connections, faulty motors, or software/firmware glitches. This issue has been highlighted extensively on YouTube.  Issue 4: Subpar Engraving Quality Substandard engraving quality can arise due to incorrect settings, a dirty lens, or a malfunctioning laser module. To rectify this, adjustments in settings, proper lens maintenance, and considering the laser module's condition are recommended.  Issue 5: Smoke and Odor Production During operation, the machine emitting smoke or strong odors might be a result of a dirty lens, improper settings, or insufficient ventilation. This concern is commonplace among lasers, particularly during cutting. Installing proper external ventilation and employing an enclosed setup are advised solutions.  Issue 6: Unusual Motor Noises Motors emitting abnormal sounds during operation may be attributed to loose connections, inadequate lubrication, or faulty motors. Similar observations have been shared on YouTube. A common cause was Ortur's inadequate tightening of drive sprocket set screws, resulting in loosening.  Issue 7: SD Card Recognition Failure When the machine fails to recognize an SD card, possible reasons include a faulty SD card, corrupted files, or firmware complications. Contacting Ortur for assistance may lead to unresponsiveness, as evidenced by my own experience.  Issue 8: Machine Freezing During Operation Machine freezing mid-operation may stem from software/firmware glitches, motherboard issues, or communication problems between the machine and the computer. Establishing a reliable link between my Ortur LM-3 and my computer proved to be a major struggle. Despite weeks of effort and assistance from Ortur, I ultimately sold my brand-new machine at a loss due to this issue.  Issue 9: Inconsistent Engravings Inconsistent engraving results might result from incorrect settings, a dirty lens, problematic materials, or a malfunctioning PWM (pulse width modulated) laser power controller. Obtaining assistance from Ortur for this issue was often challenging.  Lack of Customer Support and Service In terms of customer service and support, Ortur falls significantly short. Despite purchasing their hardware, I received no aid when problems arose. Requests for help went unanswered, and defective parts were disregarded. Unfortunately, Ortur seems unwilling to invest in its customers' needs or satisfaction.  Personal Experience with Ortur LM-3 My excitement for the Ortur Laser Master 3's potential to enhance my workshop quickly turned to disappointment and frustration. Despite its promising appearance, I encountered only obstacles and minimal assistance from Ortur. Their lone response directed me elsewhere for help. Ultimately, after exhausting various resources without resolution, I was forced to sell the Ortur LM-3 at a substantial loss, leading to the demise of my aspirations.  An Urgent Recommendation Given my ordeal, I strongly advise considering alternative options before investing in an Ortur product. It is my hope that you avoid supporting a company that displays such an evident lack of commitment to both product quality and  customer service.  Parting Thoughts I am not inclined to write negative reviews, but I felt compelled to share my experience as a cautionary tale for others. Thank you for taking the time to read my account, and I sincerely wish you success in your pursuit of a laser product that truly meets your expectations.","@kunkprime6980","2023-08-30T18:38:33",0,0

Reputable companies (J-Tech Photonics and Gweike Cloud, for example) do not do this. Yes, Atomstack buries an optical output power deep in their text, but I wouldn't trust it to be accurate given how dishonest they are in the rest of their advertising (for example, 48W for the X40 MAX is **obvious** BS to anyone familiar with diode lasers). In my opinion, we should boycott all laser manufacturers that even mention the power consumption, given how much it misleads many buyers.

Instead of the 600mm/s time of the machine advertised, it was  listed at 500mm/s. I contacted customer service and they said I got an upgraded model. But if so why is it slower.

I mean, same people buy carton sheds in usa for $500000, what can you expect from them after that lol.

One thing I never see mentioned is diode laser life. My x20 has reduced in power by about a third (according to my cut tests) with only 10s of hours on it. It's not a dirty lens/lens protector or S30 setting issue. They have agreed for me to send it back (after copious amounts of poor and repetitive formulaic email support). On the whole I'm not impressed with the build quality. The focus adjustment is sloppy (the addon z-height adjuster requires moving the M2.5 tapped holes for a limit switch), my x-axis eccentric nut was over tightened at the factory which damaged the v-wheels and I had to replace them. The cable management is poor. My next laser is going to be the Roly 20 or 40W. The Roly10W build quality is amazing and their tech support is first class.","@-vermin-","2023-06-09T18:29:12",2,0

But after reading the manual, im super scared of random reflections from the laser bouncing out of the engraver. The manual says to always wear glasses, is it really necessary? I thought I would be able to look through the glass lid while the machine is engraving ... Do I only need glasses for this? What if I open up the tray and use the pass through, or the rotary tool, does the opening at the front of the laser leave me susceptible to laser reflections and  possible burns or blindness? I know it may seem like i'm being overly paranoid, but these are the things the warning labels talk about, yet I see people operate them online as if closing the lid is more than enough. I even saw one man stoop down and get eye level with the laser as it engraved a glass cup, the front of the engraver was exposed and open. I'm a complete novice and have no basis as to what is normal to do or not to do. I would truly appreciate your insight on this.","@bravo123345","2023-05-23T08:00:13",0,1

"Ugx0uwnmti1-hwyYFlB4AaABAg","Why do these lasers cost so much?","There are a HUGE difference when it comes to power and the way Thunder Laser USA advertises the tubes provided. A 100watt Thunder has 10-20% more power than a 100watt Omtech or similar laser. As a example if you buy a 100 watt co2 laser from most manufacturers the tube has a MAXIMUM output of 100 watts but you are only recommended running them at 90% of the advertised power. Thunder Laser USA sell 100watt lasers with a usable output of 100watts. They throttle the power back from (in my case) 118 watts maximum output and this allows you to set the power to 100% in lightburn and get a true 100watt output with no risk of damage to the tube.","@ClintonCaraway-CNC","2023-05-20T20:10:03",1,0

There's two things that I would like to note - the doors require a key to open, which is annoying. All I need is a latch. I don't understand why the doors are keyed when the main lid isn't.   The other issue is not having a guide that corresponds to the bounds of the cutting area. For example, you will see a ruler on the X and Y axis. You can push material up to it and know exactly where it is every time. Trotec and epilog both have ruler guides in some of their cutting tables.  Everyone's got a different workflow though.

The Z axis would only go up but not down, wouldn't home and was doing strange things. So, I contacted Longer support to find out that my printer had a bad motherboard. Then they told me they would ship me a new motherboard and to fix it myself. I guess they got the name LONGER for it want work long but takes longer to get it fixed.

"UgwVOhf9V7RktOBUJ694AaABAg","Worth it? How the xTool P2 CO2 Laser Stacks Up Against the Competition","I'll admit, the features are great, but as usual, they are extremely overpriced for consumers.  Sadly, they are still using low quality laser tubes and mirrors. You are basically paying 2000$ for shipping software.  The cooling system is sub par, and being locked into their software to use the features is a gimmic.   If this company really wanted a consumer audience,  they would work with the popular sw companies to integrate the support they provide and also sell a product with better hardware.   This laser is being sent out in hopes to nab a few 1 off customers but geared at businesses that do not know better or want a mini laser farm.  Not including the software or time, an identical laser built with better quality parts would cost about 2k currently.   Yes it would not look as nice, but 3000$ extra just so you don't have to alignment your work is insane.  Also any business that would be using lasers, will definitely be concerned about time and ensure to align everything well to get the most bang for their buck.  In short... great idea, horrible price, wrong targeted market.  Use better hardware and reduce the price by 50% and then you will be in the right audience and market.","@Protocol-X","2023-04-26T22:19:20",0,1

FLUX HEXA 60W Laser Review","While a top speed of 900mm/s sounds nice on paper, the weight of the head means that the accellerations are slow, which more often than not makes a bigger difference. The example engraving you showed wasn't nearly large enough to make use of the speed. That is, as soon as it gets to the engrave, it should already start slowing down. Now, to bypass that, there's the overscan area, which is this case is excessively large because it needs a long time to reverse that heavy head.

For the adaptive clearance cnc bit - one obviously needs to probe Z top height and X & Y outer corners (based on the stock corner chosen or box point); but for the parallel path the cnc bit is changed to a bullnose - and while one does need to probe again Z tool height again, do we also need to probe the outer corners X & Y again? .....It can get a little confusing when you consider that the silhouette cut for the adaptive clearance bit is set to ""tool outside boundary"", while the parallel path bullnose bit chosen is set to ""tool centre on boundary"". Does fusion just do the calculation for you when you go from one bit to the next ""for the x & y box point"", or does one have to probe X & Y again (in addition to Z) for each cnc bit change?","@peterg902","2023-03-12T15:24:30",0,0

Gweike Cloud Laser Review","I would never go the Glowforge route for the same reason that I have never and will never go for iPhone over Samsung or Mac over PC. Apple are monopolists. That is to say, if you buy an Apple product you are buying into a closed ecosystem that does not allow for competition, meaning that whatever you need beyond the basic product itself, i.e., accessories, software, etc., can only be purchased from Apple at whatever price Apple dictates, take it or leave it.  Glowforge have obviously decided to emulate the Apple everything-in-house business model and for me their online-only obligatory subscription software model that excludes all other possibilities is a deal breaker, and that's before taking into account the fact that the product costs twice as much as the Gwieke.

I have a scroll saw, table saw, miter saw, router, dremel, jig saw/ basically everything but a CNC machine. What work we do is resin art and wood work for home decor. What would be the best user friendly but cuts what we need? I’m wanting more of a wood cutter and not an engraver. Yes? That would be a plus, but I’m wanting to cut words/fonts out of wood and put it on other items to paint or resin. (ie- welcome sign).

I was all ready to purchase an Ortur diode laser unit then saw the Gweiki unit and may change my mind.  Quick question.  With diodes you can mask the material and it stops charring on the back of the item.  Is this needed on CO2 devices?  Do you also need to get the honeycomb to protect the materials?  If not this may be savings between the different operations of units.  For sure leaning towards the Gweiki..thanks","@guynotes777","2023-01-14T03:52:48",0,0

"Ugy4PEGzweIhLQZBM7R4AaABAg","$4000 cheaper than Glowforge AND better?  OMTech Polar Review","I think there is a lot of nuance in getting the right laser cutter. The Polar looks like an interesting machine and I might be interested if I was getting something for my house. I'm a teacher and the Glowforge works best for my classroom. The footprint is just right for the classroom (looks similar to the Polar). The web interface is a selling point, allowing us to manage multiple users easily and not worry about software. I only use the interface to set up my cuts, where the camera is very useful. Everything else is done in Illustrator, Inkscape, or Vectornator. The subscription is completely optional and unnecessary. Respectfully, the review makes it sound almost required - that is simply incorrect. I have 5 Glowforges (the plus model). They are used constantly, the oldest being 3 years old, and I have never had a serious problem with any of them. Support was quick and helpful when an issue did present itself, the GF was cutting again by the end of the day. It is a no fuss machine - and that is what I need when working with 100 students each quarter. If I were buying a hobby machine I would have different requirements, but the Glowforge is pretty awesome for us. Just wanted to provide a different perspective/experience.","@johncalvert7085","2023-01-13T13:44:42",17,4

I just wondered if you could help clarify something?  The M1 spec states a 385x300mm (15x12 inch) working area, but is that the max size of the material sheet BEFORE cutting or just the max size of the cutting area?  For example, can I insert a sheet of 8mm MDF into the unit that is say 400x310mm and then design a shape to cut inside the 385x300 working area?  The reason I ask is that the shape I need to produce could be 300x300mm so it would be nice to be able to rough cut a slightly larger sheet to then make sure the finished shape can be cut out allowing for a small border.

"UgyzOWY1NV9qLuCHUmJ4AaABAg","This is the World's Fastest Laser","I’ve had my eye on the Aeon Mira 5S Redline, and I have a few questions regarding my product line that I plan to work with. I want to make sure the machine fits my specific needs, so I’m hoping you can provide some insights.  1. Can the engraving and cutting height be automatically adjusted to uneven surfaces (e.g., wavy materials)? Ideally, I’d like a 3D mapping system where I can freely define the measurement points based on the material. I’d like to set the number of measurement points per square cm or at least define a measurement area to ensure the engraving or 3D map is as accurate as possible.  2. Is there an automated height detection system or any add-ons for soft materials like leaves or flowers, which are difficult to measure with mechanical height detection?  3. What is the noise level of the machine and the exhaust system? I plan to use it in my home, so that’s important for me.  4. When working with larger materials that are fed through the machine, is it possible for the engraving or cutting to be automatically detected and seamlessly extended? I’m looking for intelligent software that can adjust the engraving path automatically without needing to manually realign the material.  5. Do you use or recommend any infeed track with a stopper and optional conveyor belt for precise material alignment and consistent movement at the right angle during the process?  6. Is there an intelligent function for engraving multiple identical materials? I would like the machine to detect and optimize the engraving process across multiple pieces with identical designs, to save time and ensure consistent results.  I know that the xTool P2S has most of the features I need, and their software is actually quite good. However, it seems that they may have purchased reviews on Trustpilot, and their customer support has been quite disappointing, so I don’t fully trust this company.  I’m also interested in experimenting with inlays in small QR codes, around 30x30mm, where the glass tube CO2 laser might reach its limits. It could be better to go for an RF option, but I’m not sure if Aeon is the right choice for this. You may have a better idea of what would suit my needs best, considering you’ve tested a larger product range and are up to date with the latest technologies.  I’m based in Germany, so it would be good if there aren’t any issues with shipping or customer support, but that’s mostly optional.  Best regards","@kreativerpinsel3569","2024-12-21T02:56:09",0,0

This is comparable to lower end CO2 machines. So why not just get the CO2? Well, for one, the cut quality seems to be cleaner with a diode laser, as they usually have smaller kerf and are consistent across the entire work area. The versatility of light cutting up to 15mm and more detailed engraving in a single machine is probably a better option for hobbyists than a small CO2 laser. Or am I wrong and there are CO2 lasers that outperform the engraving quality of diodes?","@amconsole","2024-12-14T09:40:51",0,0

After about 2 months I put it under a shelf in my building and haven't touched it since.

A little learning curve with Lightburn but being new to engraving, its not that bad IMO. Watch a few videos and you are good to go.  I am curious about the noise of the base unit laser one. How loud is it in decibels? How loud when you add in the air assist? Also what type of maintenance is needed for the laser one (weekly, monthly? your recommendations). Also a quick run down for new people like me on what materials you can use with it would have been nice (but I can check the website for that).   I'm looking at getting a laser this Jan or Feb.

"UgwDXDAC54ndyfJcPnl4AaABAg","Pro Desktop Laser at a Budget Price - OneLaser X Series Review","Great reviews, and thanks for the details !  I’m totally on board with this ranking.   I had a Polar before—it worked fine at first, but quickly turned into a disaster. The inside of the machine? Constantly filthy. You have to clean the lens every couple of hours to keep it from getting scorched, and the build quality is… let’s just say, not great. I’ve spent so much time on fixing shit, dat I could’ve paid for a whole new machine by now. And customer service? Practically nonexistent. They pass you around, and might call back two weeks later, right after you’ve DIY-fixed the issues.  The P2S was my top pick—not just for the minor upgrades, but mostly for the bed size (23.6” x 12”) and speed. And let’s be real—their ads are literally everywhere. You can’t escape them! This company must have piles of cash to burn; it’s insane how much they’re pouring into marketing. There are other niche brands like Bolt and Mira, but their bed sizes are too small for my needs, and the pricing is all over the place. Then I saw the ONELASER X, launching right after the P2S, and this new brand checked all my boxes: a bigger bed size (26” x 14”), excellent build quality, twice the speed, a clean cabinet design with an enclosed base, and full US-based support., Honestly, I was nervous about going with a new brand, but now I’m convinced I made the right choice.  Hopefully, OneLaser ships my order on time—because that’s the important part they can’t afford to mess up! I mean that seriously.","@Edward-yq3yj","2024-11-09T23:23:37",2,0

I'm glad you suggested getting the air assist, setting up proper ventilation, and preparing for fume management. Thanks for the excellent insights—I’m looking forward to working with this machine!  One of the most innovative features, and something I find especially valuable, is the built-in air quality indicator. This sensor is a game changer, allowing real-time air quality monitoring, which is particularly helpful in a closed room with only a window for ventilation. I had been considering purchasing a separate air quality sensor, so having this integrated feature is a fantastic benefit.

Not ONLY is it removable, but it changes its placement, so that your auto-focus/focal distance doesn't change.   For $700, you're MUCH better off buying the Thunder, specifically due to their history and customer service. I wouldn't trust a brand new no-name company with that chunk of money or support, as things with these lasers can definitely go wrong/need replacement parts.  Why buy from a company thats trying to trim/cheapen the item, when you can literally buy from their supplier? Its like buying a knockoff.","@Stevieboy7","2024-11-08T20:45:46",2,3

However the problem with these style of videos is where a key piece of explanation is not covered. So when I get halfway through doing what you showed, I get stuck. How do you line up the taped up image when gluing it down? Do you use some sort of registration marks or are you just eyeballing it? I have a hard time imagining that I am going to be able to line up something even half that complex and get every little part in the right spot just by eyeballing it.

"UgythdCc6sAGcj_59N54AaABAg","I Tested Every Desktop Laser - This is the Best","First of all, great review and categorization of thoose lasers! However, as a beginner, I feel like some essential information is missing, especially for desktop models. Next year, I plan to start working with small parts, around 1-4 cm thick. I mostly need engraving, and I’d like to work on multiple pieces at once (potentially different sizes but the same height), letting the laser run while I do other tasks. For this, the laser should have the capability to automatically detect the position of the workpieces and center engravings, like texts or QR codes. Otherwise, I would have to manually measure and align each piece to the 0,0 point. For example, if one piece is 50mm wide and another is 52mm wide, and I want a QR code centered, the laser should be able to automatically center it if needed. This is especially important when dealing with multiple pieces lying next to each other. I can't rely on precise X, Y coordinates because the pieces might not always be perfectly aligned, or there could be a 1-2 mm gap between them, which could throw off the centering of the engravings.","@nilsruhmann3571","2024-10-17T17:01:53",1,1

I always stop here first when trying to learn about new and innovative lasers on the market. I have an ambitious project idea I was hoping to get your opinion on.  I'm thinking about building a really large work area diode setup for cutting thin fabrics. These will likely be polyester, nylon, and dyneema fabrics for cutting tent patterns. I will need it to have a 72"" usable width for the work area and probably at least 140"" length or the ability to easily and accurately index the next section of the cut (floor panels will commonly be 108"" long and need straight edge cuts). Due to the crazy size, i'm trying to find a way to make it collapsible, something i could put up and take down easily. Another idea might be to rig it to hang from the garage ceiling and drop down as needed. Hoping to go lightweight and establish rigidity with whatever i set it on for cutting (possibly concrete driveway or lightweight ply base if mounting to ceiling). Lastly, it wouldn't hurt to prioritize speed over accuracy as a cut line within an 1/8"" of the intended cut is plenty accurate (no engraving needed with this setup) Any thoughts on how achievable this would be? Not sure how the belt drive accuracy would be at that scale. Also, if you're aware of a smaller machine designed to index quickly/accurately for large prints that you think could work well in this use case, I'd love to hear about it:).

"UgwGeavwHpZQHpwGWj54AaABAg","The Best Laser Engraver & Cutter to Get at ANY Budget","The only thing better than having your own laser cutter is having a friend who has a laser cutter.......find a friend who has an Xtool P2 or similar.  For safety reasons, I will never be anywhere near an open-frame device even if I'm wearing OD6 (or higher) laser goggles. If you have one of these, at least put an enclosure around it. BTW, a pair of laser safety goggles is a lot cheaper than eye surgery, or living the rest of your life with impaired or no vision.  Air-assist. You really need it to reduce the fire hazard, as it squelches flames that try to form while cutting. Remember, a laser cutter works by burning-away material.  Smoke. You dont realize how MUCH smoke gets produced till you do your first cut. Even a few small cuts on thin MDF or plywood will stink-up your entire garage. Which goes back to the first point: You need an enclosure for safety reasons as well as to gather the smoke for your exhaust fan (or air purifier).  Cooling. We havn't done any lengthy processing on the P2 yet. It's water-cooled and I've only seen the temp go up 1-2 degrees during usage, even when the laser is running at 100% power. A 55W CO2 laser is around 20% efficient, so you probably have 300 watts coming thru the laser tube. It's going to take awhile for that to heat-up a water tank. But if you're using an air-cooled fiber laser, it's going to heat-up faster even though it's a lot more efficient than CO2. Probably a non-issue for hobby work, because your cutter will pause a few times if it needs to cools-down.","@gregebert5544","2024-10-14T16:12:04",0,0

"UgzzS3ZRmD8QT3D3QcV4AaABAg","Watch This Before Buying a Laser Cutter & Engraver in 2025","Great and informative video...  One option you didn't cover with regard to desktop machines is the CO2 machines sourced from China, typically available on eBay.  I went this route about 4yrs ago.  Purchased a 12"" x 20"", 50W sealed tube CO2 machine for about $1200.  It has many of the features of the more expensive domestically sourced (US made) machines.  It's not quite as refined, but it does the job just fine.   Worked for 30yrs in the industrial laser field and this machine, even though it's a lot cheaper, is every bit a ""real"" machine as the more expensive ones.  Though I don't use it for ""production work"", it could...  That said, not sure how long it'll last for with that kind of use, but for hobby users like me, it's the perfect low cost, nearly full featured machine.   The only thing mine doesn't have is a chiller and auto focus.  I use a large bin full of DI water that can be cooled by tossing in a few frozen bottles of bottled water.  Though it doesn't have auto focus, it does have a manual Z-axis table feature and I use a dial indicator to set the height based off the material thickness used.  Again...  Great and very informative video.  Continue to be amazed at the scope and quantity of equipment available to hobbyists these days!","@WHJeffB","2024-10-08T02:14:13",36,5

"Ugw-SSm91Q-4kKrue-x4AaABAg","I Tested Every Desktop Laser - This is the Best","As a Glowforge Pro owner, there are a couple things that you did omit. I have looked at light burn and believe that I could certainly use it. But, for hobbyists and those who are not using their laser printer day in and day out, Glowforge has a remarkably easy to use interface, one that my mother could figure out.  And let's not forget, Apple made there reputation based on software interface and ease of use .  But that said, the detractors are significant and includes several you missed. Important among them is the fact that you have to pay $240 per year just to be able to save your files to the cloud. Because they have you locked in, any file or project you create will disappear within 30 days unless you pay them their ransom.   Furthermore, and this is a very little known issue, there is absolutely no way to save a project from glowforge's cloud to your desktop or any local storage device. This means that if you spend your time setting up the perfect print and go forage, you can forget about saving it unless you are paying their yearly subscription fee. I am so surprised that nobody has mentioned this as I quit paying my yearly subscription fee and lost hundreds of project files.   Similar to this videos conclusion, I would not recommend this product to anyone at any price.","@ChippWalters","2024-10-05T04:10:16",1,0

"Ugy_OIa-TUHNOroAoLZ4AaABAg","Why is xTool so Popular - The P2S Desktop Laser Review","Does this ""smart align - take an image and get a proper placement on the material"" really work? I have tried so many times to use various cameras with Lightburn (Atomstack x20 pro, including the original Atomstack camera kit) to place content precisely - it's ALWAYS disappointing.   Not only for the obvious reasons:  If you use material with different thickness, you need to re-calibrate.  And it's really hard to mount a camera over a laser in a consistent spot: all constructins I have seen with beams and tripods and ""mount to a lid"" just didn't have the accuracy required for it to be useful. The camera will always move a tiny bit out of calibration. Not only that, but even if you really mount it as sturdy as possible and have the same thickness of material all the time, it will just by itself loose calibration within 2-3 runs. Not only that, even if you use fixed jigs (no camera), the laser itself isn't consistent in positioning, you may get 2-5mm shifts randomly.  So all in all the Lightburn camera alignment feature is just a collosal disappointment.  Is that what you show in the video - randomly positioned material with accurate detection and accurate positioning - REALLY REALLY reality or is that staged B.S.? Does it REALLY get the content onto the material in the right angle, in the right place? Can there be a proper review of this feature, please?  Thanks!","@j.4941","2024-09-19T22:26:48",0,0

The open frame category is designed for a low upfront cost and not meant to be used as they are but be equipped with accessories later.

Instead of having an always ticked ""enclosure"" column, you should add important parameters missing from your sheet: * how the focus works: by moving the module or bed - as this limits functionality, you can't easily do curved surface processing when the whole bed has to move up and down * rotary attachment support - out of the box, with optional riser base, etc. * pass through / removable bottom plate  BTW as far as I know WeCreat somehow shot off xTool (ex employees?) - their software is basically a clone of xCS 1.x.

After a few weeks/months they came up with ""addons"" they should have been part of the machine from the start on.   Honeycomb on the M1, the Extension for the M1, the rotary tool 2, after you recently bought der v1 that was not that long on the market, ...  And shortly after you bought a machine, they release the next one and ""forget"" about the old one ... to this day there is no fucking posibility to use Lightburn with the M1 (just with the Laser, i know that the cutting will not work with Lightburn). With the build in camera you're fucked if it comes to Precision. That Fisheye Lense didn't give you a chance if you try to engrave precicley. So let me use coordinates instead for god sake ...

If you are moving between functions, specifically going from the laser to any of the other functions, will you have to perform a deep clean of the bed area to get rid of any of the residue/resins/ cut pieces etc produced by the laser cutting before placing the mat for blade cutting?  As I see it, if you don’t, the mat will be likely to pick up any of the by products of cutting and it may be difficult to ensure the smooth surface required. Perhaps they will include a cutting bed and a crafting bed as a simple solution?","@martinshackleton2451","2024-07-11T07:49:27",5,3

"UgzP4pn6VZsNRXkgKE14AaABAg","I was wrong about the xTool D1...","PLEASE! PLEASE! DO NOT BUY - I have spent about $3000 with Xtool - I purchased the D1Pro and some other stuff almost a year ago and I have had nothing but issues. Trying to work with Customer Service is INSANITY! I also purchased the Infrared, and it has never worked. I was told by Xtool ""Regarding the problem of the infrared laser head, many customers will not be able to use it successfully due to improper operation."" So even if you follow their instructions and use the samples they sent, you still maybe doing something wrong. What are you doing wrong?--- you don't know, and they don't either, so you end up with a $500 paper weight. I watched tons of Youtube reviews on the D1Pro and they all gave glowing reviews; so, I went with it. Unfortunately, I and many others have not had the same success with Xtool as indicated in the Youtube reviews. After so many issues I decided to invest in another laser and speaking to some of Xtool competitors I asked question in hope that I don't end up with $3000 paper weights. The most chilling thing discovered was they are aware of Xtool and the issues the customers face. I noticed that a lot of the issues I've had with Xtool out the gate without me asking any questions they spell out what the machine can and can't do, their customer service and support. One guy said their Support Agents respond with 4 to 9 minutes and they quickly resolve your issue because they understand many of their customer use it for business purposes. Better than the 24 to 72 hours waiting for Xtool to respond and two weeks later you are still no where close to a resolution. OH, and those that have State side support definitely let you know that.   I really don't want anyone to encounter this; because when you are not a wealthy person $3000 is a huge investment for you. PLEASE when researching for purchase do more than watch YouTube videos; it could save you time, money and peace of mind. PLEASE be sure to ask about customer service\support, warranty, replacement parts. A big one would be ""What issues are commonly encountered by customers and how do you work to resolve those issues?   I saw a post on Facebook asking, ""Why are so many people selling their Xtool?"" I laughed because I was looking to see how easy it would be to sell it. RFLOL   When you have a quality product it is GREAT! I really enjoy engraving, cutting and making things it is so therapeutic. DON""T FORGET to be diligent in your research.","@whynow3792","2024-07-10T03:23:05",0,0

I believe the M1 has the camera. So my question/s 1) Can a riser be installed like on the M1 for a rotary attachment. 2) Is there a pass through or is it limited to just one size. 3) what is the max working area? 4) Have you received any information about an IR module option. 5) Does this work through the XTool Creative Space Software and Lightburn 6) Which Filter is needed to run indoors, is it the same as the F1 or does it require the large 699.00 model. 7) what type of ink cartridge is used for the printing and what type of ink is used. 8) What modules come with the base product. 9) Will it work with the screen printer.  10) If no camera will it use the iPhone option like the S1 can do now because the teaser ad shows batch printing so curious how that works. Ok so lots of questions I know but trying to decide do I pass this up and just get the S1. I hate that neither have the camera yet they installed the camera on the M1. I sometimes wonder what they are thinking when designing these machines. For a few bucks more it would be a real game changer had they added it. It looks similar to the Glowforge Aura but that does have the camera and pass through, but no rotary.","@YesMyOpinionMatters","2024-07-02T03:37:49",0,3

Personally I would leave out packaging cost because that can be put into your shipping price, that the customer pays.   I would add in misc business costs as a % on top - rent, supplies, kitchen, cleaning, insurance, registrations, safety equipment etc.  As for laser time, i've found that it is unrealistic unless it is the ONLY factor in pricing a custom one off job. A lot of people online use laser time but if you're also factoring machine cost, maintenance and labour, then counting laser time is basically double charging (in terms of working out your costs).   However it does work in figuring out how to price a custom jobs on the fly, where you aren't making the same kind of item hundreds of times.  Ultimately if you are making at least 3-4x the cost of materials then you're doing alright.","@kennuimuffins2426","2024-06-17T03:30:06",0,0

Many other cheaper diode lasers have auto leveling via stepper motor and height detection DURING engraving, and don’t rely on a roller in a specific location.  3.) The overall concept saves storage and transportation space, but is very limiting otherwise. Including (inexpensive) expansion kits, higher power laser modules etc.  Interesting product (for specific applications)!  Best wishes","@asc23channel","2024-06-04T05:38:42",1,0

Now setting up new Roly that just arrived. If you have two lasers you have one.If you have one laser you have none.","@akiddoo8113","2024-05-17T13:40:18",0,0

"UgzbBbQFFitPiCXlUsB4AaABAg","This is The Best Laser Cutter and Engraver","The thing i notice is that you do not make a difference yet between the kind of laser glowforge for example is a CO2 laser , Creality is a Diode Laser , Xtools got Diode and Co2 depending on what one you choose  i can not say if it would make any big difference, but i can imaging that some people are less happy with a 5K printer that get outperformed by a sub 500 printer because of diode vs co2  so if enough data is present, can we get a quick breakdown of the co2 / fiber / diode classes so they stay equal to a certain point ?  also i love the video, it is well done and it was interesting, i expected way more of sculptfun but seems people thinks otherwise this also makes me wonder, atomstack for example (if i am not mistaken )  is just a offbrand ( or premium brand ) of a other laser company, so maybe those can be split up to ?","@PowerChaos","2024-05-17T00:58:50",2,1

"UgwU8bnEdmKqxN_Iicl4AaABAg","This is The Best Laser Cutter and Engraver","I have owned several lasers over time. From my first Laser Master 2, to the Xtool S1 and P2. I wish I had known about the survey, I would have contributed. I actually sold my P2 because it was just way too cumbersome. The Xtool machines are a good bang for your buck, but there are two things I absolutely HATE about them. 1st, the hose size for the exhaust tubing is 3 inch. This means it won't fit most standard duct tubing which is 4 inches or more. I had to print adapters for the S1 and P2. There is no good reason for them not to use the most common size. Though I guess this could be some attempt at proprietary BS so that you have to buy tubing and exhaust accessories from them. 2nd, the implementation of lightburn compatibility is terrible. It's janky as all hell and badly thought out. Plus the camera functions of the P2 never worked in lightburn for me. If I could do it again, I would go with a company like Thunder Laser. They are also Chinese, but they have USA based support and sales people. So my issues are never brushed aside and the BS claims are less.","@antoniomromo","2024-05-15T23:41:35",1,0

I have used quite a few different software programs to accomplish my goals. I used QGIS for when I needed buildings, Snazzy Maps for streets, roads and highways, finally Open Street Map for a little bit of both. Snazzy is the easiest but you can’t export SVG files for editing, nor does it do buildings at the resolution I need. QGIS and Open Street Map both do buildings but have Steeper leaning curves with multiple steps and that slows down my workflow. I would love to offer custom maps, but the time it takes me to design one map, to sell that one map, makes it a poor financial decision (time is money). I have other products that are far easier to make, and therefore more profitable. If Laser Map Maker is easier to use and can draw up buildings and exports SVG files, then I can make custom maps faster and make more money, then it is a good deal to me.","@jeweldey3699","2024-05-08T21:46:21",2,2

"UgwxfFRbQtFqHT0KBlF4AaABAg","This is the World's Fastest Laser","I clicked on the link to see how much these are going to cost, since as of right now it is only a pre-order. There were a lot of ways to contact them to have them get back to you, but no way to actually find out the price without them having your contact info and being able to possibly spam you with sales calls. Maybe I'm the only one, but that makes this a non-starter for me. I used to teach laser cutting at a maker space on a $75,000 laser cutter (I did not own it), so I know they can get up there, and I'm sure this one is no where near that. But, I'm not going to jump through hoops to find out.  Some people will say, ""Well, if you have to ask, you can't afford it."" Except that if you are a small shop, and have a budget, it is actually possible that you could afford it, and you would like to know so you can set aside the money,.......

"UgzMDMLsmhM055ML_d54AaABAg","Can You Trust Product Reviews?","Thank you for tackling what could be a thorny subject. Personally I always love to listen to reviewers' takes on the machines and I usually form some opinion using an aggregate of reviews. And even this only forms part of my overall opinion. Reviews are great but they never take the place of doing your own hard research. And you have to accept that MOST of these lasers are built in part or in whole in China where the quality is not always consistent. So no matter what you do you may end up with a bad sample of an otherwise good laser. I am much more concerned about the company I am buying from and their customer service than the actual laser itself 99% of the time.  But that being said I do thing the reviews have value as long as nobody doing them tries to hide the fact that they received the laser for free for review. Honesty and openness are the requirement for these reviews to have any merit. You have never given me any reason to think you are otherwise so I love following your channel.","@jackhelm9852","2024-04-25T22:10:28",4,0

"UgxX5xL0SxdYrfT_yJ94AaABAg","This is the World's Fastest Laser","I watch you regularly, and expected that your knowledge level would be a bit higher. First, she talks about the speed. Owning an Epilog Fusion Pro, I know something about speed. At top speed and max output power, you are hardly leaving a mark on wood. So, the speed argument is a little dumb. The accordions on the side of the gantry to protect the internals of the machine is something Epilog has had for years. The idea that somehow, the autofocus built-in to the lens carriage is something new is also wrong. Epilog, Trotec, and honestly several others I can think of have been doing that for years. Servo motors? Welcome to 2020. Let's talk resolution. 1000 DPI, is nowhere near class-leading. She talks about how happy she is about how rigid they are, being built of steel. Why did they add several hundred pounds to the machine by cheapening out with steel when they should have gone with military grade aluminum. I notice that my Epilog is under 300 pounds while the Aeon with the same bed size is 550 pounds. Some of them go up to 1,500 pounds. She talks about being able to change frequency, well I am not certain, but I think several companies have had that for years. I know I can change that on mine. The drop-in water cooled tube that doesn't change alignment is cool, bravo on that point! Even if you could buy one, (many people can not get a regular Mira for months) some interviews have said their Signature series (the only one that can boast all of this speed and ceramic RF core) is not even on the horizon for 4 to 6 months. Last thing is price. Who in the name of all that is holy is going to pay Epilog prices for a Chinese machine? I think it is just a reverse engineered Epilog or Trotec. There was a time when I would have looked at an Aeon or Thunder, but they were just too slow for my production needs. And please, add an LCD screen!

So reality machine time is human time. Yes you can leave a bit, and do other things but those hundreds of hours of machine time, you still need to be in the shop. More just pointing out the time calculation gets complicated.

Before fully understanding the logic used to control the laser, I was surprised to see that machines with 600 to 1,000 mm speeds could only produce parts at roughly the same run time as machines with a maximum speed of 300 to 400 mm. The reason is that the faster machines have to overshoot the work area when ramping up and slowing down.

Or should I start with cheap ones and upgrade later on?  Would this come more expensive in the long run buying these  cheap laser machine and upgrade to Xtool?

"UgyxlMQfcTs5gZHSnzl4AaABAg","Worth it? How the xTool P2 CO2 Laser Stacks Up Against the Competition","Xtool advertising is misleading. They say the P2 works with Lightburn (with exception of auto focus, cameras and curve feature). Given i already have a D1 and Lightburn works perfectly with it, I had no reason to assume Lightburn wouldn't work with the P2 with the exception of the explicitly stated limitations above.  I can understand not having the curve support, but all other functions should be available. Also, the XCS software is horrible. I would not expect it to be on par with LIghtburn, but there are a multitude of little things like being able to easily define layers or remove the close up view when not needed. All in all, unless you are happy to only work in XCS (assuming full support for Lightburn never comes), save your money and buy another brand CO2 (Monoport, Omtech) and get a fiber laser to go with it for what you pay for the P2. I am posting this comment not as a criticism of the this video, but in the hopes that someone watching this video in trying to decide whether to buy the P2 or not, are more fully informed. I did a fair amount of research before buying the P2 and everyone either intentionally or unknowingly failed to mention just how limited LIghtburn for P2 is nor just how bad the XCS software is.","@OnlineAnonymity-z9s","2024-02-03T19:00:09",1,1

You went back to 1928, but let’s go further back: We saw the same trends with new technologies like electricity, the steam engine (revolutionised the weaving industry), the wheel…. Each time, we have seen new jobs emerge as a result.  For woodworkers, we can be divided into two categories: Some are production focussed, churning out the same chairs, tables, coasters every day in as high a volume as possible. For them, automation will be a God-send as they will be able to produce more a day. The other category are the more “creative” (no offence, producers) that hardly ever make two identical products. Here, machines may replace certain steps, but not the entire creative and assembly process.

My partner got excited and asked me if i would rather save up a little more money and then get this 2 in one, because i would like to try laser cutting but its not my main focus and the machines are rather expensive.  So here i am trying to research if the printer is worth it or not and from your review, which was sooo much more helpful since you know the details about laser cutting and most other reviewers are 3D printers, and i think i feel like this is a 100% the route i should go, i get to have the 3D printer i wanted but as an added bonus i can play around with the laser cutter function and it sounds like the quality and what you get is quite good even though the size is a trade off.

"UgzywqRll-IE4TJO5t94AaABAg","Do Lasers Ruin 3D Printer’s? Bambu Lab H2D Laser Review","I believe that opening the vent enables air INTO the machine which can then go to the exhaust. Without the vent opening, this sealed machine will have no way for fresh air to get into the machine at a high enough volume to not starve the filter. It’s clever, as the vent is in the front top, while the exhaust is in the middle height at the rear. So this gives you an air flow that goes right through the shortest distance, which happens to be the area where the laser is working.  If the size of the bed is ok for people and you just don’t have the room, then this is fine. The quality seems to be pretty good. As far as the different time scales for the laser or the printer, well, you just have to manage your time. If you know what you’re going to be doing, then do the short job first. These things are a compromise. If you’re willing to accept that, then it’s great. If you can’t, then this isn’t the machine for you. But don’t forget this also cuts and draws.

"Ugw-nKsoOnHFCrTsHAl4AaABAg","Do Lasers Ruin 3D Printer’s? Bambu Lab H2D Laser Review","Absolutely save the money and buy a dedicated laser printer.  The difference that you didn't mention when you compared the additional cost  of the 40W Bambu when compared to just buying the S1 is the cut size.  The camera is a nice feature, but with the alignment functions of the S1 it is minimal.  Having roughly twice the cut capacity, plus having a dedicated machine is going to completely offset the few hundred dollar difference.  Plus, XCS is a great software solution on it's own for beginners, but you can use LightBurn on the S1 when you grow beyond the limited feature set you get with Bambu Studio.  Additionally, I guarantee that the more you use the laser, the more dirty the inside of the 3D printer is going to get.  Take a picture of the inside of a P2 or P2S that gets daily use and you'll see what I mean.  Finally, the problem with having a shared machine is that when the H2D eventually has a failure, you lose all of your ability to work whereas if you have different machines, you can at least still do something.","@spetsdod","2025-06-21T06:46:11",0,0

That may sound a bit odd, but the laser module is already shipped separately from the printer itself, and the Laser edition actually has other features that the non-Laser variants do not such as cutting and drawing.  Once the laser module is sold separately (I didn't find it on their store at the time of writing), then you could buy one when/if you wanted one.  They have talked about releasing an upgrade kit for the basic H2D, but given that the upgrade kit just puts you at the same level as a H2D Laser without the laser, I'd rather just buy that from the start.","@shinaikouka","2025-06-21T06:32:24",9,2

After contesting the charge on my credit card, whether that had anything to do with it or not (?), I did finally receive all ordered items.  The rotary was broken and AtomStack replaced that within a week.  With the exception of the 3rd mirror adjustment at the laser head - difficult to adjust due to the air assist tubing and the auto focusing wires disconnecting regularly (faulty connecter), oh and the decision not to provide free shipping so I'm still out $400, the machine is actually pretty good so far.  Pro: very robust metal build, this thing is solid! Proprietary software is good, I use both that and Lightburn, depending on what I am doing, and it is pretty precise.  Cons: difficult lens adjustment (laser head design could have been a bit better at little extra effort), rotary accessories are workable but made of plastic and don't have the same sturdiness of the laser (honestly, it's a beast!), but they work, just be gentle with them.  Support is decent.  I ordered during the Dragon Festival so that holiday gummed up the customer service a bit.  Expect delays in response due to  being on the other side of the world and the language barrier... some of the replies were difficult to decipher due to the language barrier.

If you do not have a closed box laser with an activated carbon filter or at least an exhaust system outside the workshop, do not think about the laser business. These toys for a few hundred dollars are only suitable for amateur fun - no protection against the laser beam (risk of eye damage), toxic fumes, low power, low speed.

Community members have had to build custom print profiles for orca because the default profiles were extremely poor and resulted in repeated print failures. There also have been multiple reports of customers returning defective printers under warranty and being sent back a barely functional refurbished unit with major problems. I am confident this product works well and based on what I see there's nothing else on the market similarly priced.

You can buy UV ink in 1kg bottles if you own a regular UV printer... the inks expire quite fast, and you have to constantly clean/cycle the printer. If you think your dead inkjet printheads were bad, UV is infinitely worse and requires a lot of maintenance. I can definitely see people with dried up print heads if they just do this for fun once in a while.

This machine has proprietary parts like a Glowforge, so when it breaks, you’ll likely have to pay to ship it to China for repairs, covering shipping and tariffs both ways, which could get pricey fast. The ink is already overpriced at $299 for 600ml, and with tariffs, it jumps to $477 to ship to you—that’s $12.50–$23.50 for just 100 small prints, compared to the 3060UV-V2’s $0.13 (one of many uv desktops) eufyMake’s lack of transparency on ink usage and support is a red flag, and they’ve already abandoned their 3D printer backers in the past, leaving them with nothing. They’re promising free shipping on 6,437 units, but that’s $7.9 million in shipping and tariffs they might not handle. If they do, this risks delays or hidden fees. You’ll also have to raise your prices much higher than expected to recoup costs on this toss-away machine. Also, could you please provide precise ml/print data for different print types (e.g., small prints, 3D textures, A4 prints) to help us calculate true costs Also, are there plans to ship from the United States for us to avoid tariffs? Or is this printer going to collect dust from customers that can’t afford the now higher cost for the ink?","@LaserCraftersHub","2025-05-05T12:51:36",0,0

The only channel that seems to be asking the tough questions is Ogrinz Labs, who did not get a free printer. Will people pay for an imposto (raised/textured) painting? Where the cost is $22 in ink, and 7 hours to print. And when so many people buy these UV printers, the market will be flooded with people selling raised prints. The tumbler and mug markets are already saturated with sublimated items. The flat metal market, and sticker market the same. With heat transfers, sublimation, vinyl, direct to film (dtf), white toner laser, and other uv printers, the market is saturated with sellers using these technologies. This printer looks so cool, but that's also its problem ... when tons of people buy them, the market will be oversupplied with sellers. That's not a market I want in on. Etsy and eBay will be flooded with AI, raised/textured prints within days. And it will be a race to the bottom.

The shipper called me and said it would be here Tuesday and they would call 30 minutes out.  Well, my wife was home all day because she is a kept woman 😜but they never called and just dropped it in the driveway… My wife called and said your laser is here but I can’t move it! lol So delivery is not the best. It sat in my driveway until I got home. Just know, no porch pirate is going to snatch it off your property.  It weighs 179 pounds! This is not your parents’ xTool  Laser!!

The REAL Cost of the EufyMake UV Printer","Nah... most of us that are deep into printing, know that there's only a handful of chemical ink producers, and it's no longer the 90s, and basically everyone follows very similar formulas and pigment densities. UV ink is only special in it's resin binder that's activated by very specific wavelength of UV light. The most common is 395um. But even still many commercial UV inks will cure within a range of 385um to 405um.  That being said... if I bought this printer, the first thing I would do is learn the cartridge system, and see if they are chip coding them or not. And secondly, if there was a way to non-destructively refill them. BECAUSE, even really good 3rd party UV ink should only cost you between $15-20 per liter. There might be some variance on the white, it's particle size and what specific inkjet heads they are using. Again, this is a start-up, so I promise you they aren't designing their own piezo electric print heads from scratch. They are sourcing them from Ricoh or Epson. If you know which one, you can buy inks specifically tailored to that particular print head. It's not that complicated.

"Ugx6uX216OOh-4yMk8h4AaABAg","$300 Ink?! The REAL Cost of the EufyMake UV Printer","Thanks for the review and updates. Super fast response to questions! Awesome. Subscription software for functionality (credits...) is where I might have to think twice... At the forefront is ""3D relief"" or ""depth printing"" and that, from your brief answer, seems to be tied to a subscription that gives credits. Free tier has limited use, but based on their ""you can make this much per day printing with this machine"" the cost in credits should be calculated into this.   Regardless, great product, wonderful price for entry. A bit shady in not being upfront and clear as to how much total running costs will be. I'd hoped companies would take note after the BambuLab ""this is how we will operate going forward"" backlash but looks like more *asterisk* stuff could be on the radar.   Thanks for the updates again. See if you can get more information on the subscription tiers/specifics. If it's anything like Adobe (which I love, but costs a bit) then this is something to definitely factor into the cost of printing products as well as the ink.  Imagine a tradeshow/event with a line of 20+ clients and you run out of ""credits"" for generation...ChatGPT like tiers? Free - $20 - $200?....scary...","@ATLnJP","2025-05-03T03:58:44",0,0

"Ugw3i29SM7TVM5S55154AaABAg","Is THIS the Future of Printing?  - eufyMake E1 UV Printer","Established companies like Anker, the owner of Eufy, should not be using Kickstarter as a funding platform. These corporations have ample financial resources to support their own projects, yet they turn to crowdfunding as a way to shift all risk onto consumers and backers. If their product fails—like their previous 3D printers—these companies remain unaffected, profiting from sold units while losing nothing on research and development. What makes this situation particularly concerning is that working units of the product already exist, as multiple YouTubers have demonstrated in their reviews. So what, exactly, is being “Kickstarted”? The manufacturing process? This is not what Kickstarter was originally intended for. Unfortunately, more and more established and profitable companies continue to exploit the platform, using it as a shield to protect their investments rather than a genuine tool for innovation. This unethical practice places all financial risk on backers, who are left vulnerable if the product fails. Meanwhile, content creators often enable this cycle by eagerly accepting free units and promoting them without scrutiny. If influencers refused to provide exposure to these companies without genuine accountability, failed launches could force corporations to rethink their approach and adhere to proper business practices.","@EliteCanadian92","2025-04-30T12:31:31",0,0

"UgxBAkFlsDxjBMWDqAt4AaABAg","Is THIS the Future of Printing?  - eufyMake E1 UV Printer","I put down my deposit so now I'm just waiting for the Kick to start.  I have a few questions, I'm hoping you can answer.  1) How long do the resin cartridges last, ie: how much can you print?  I know that is somewhat subjective, based on what you print, and how much of each color you use, but take your Mando print on wood.  How much resin did that take?  How many of those could you print with a single kit?  2) Since the printer has to lay down a white layer under anything that isn't being printed on a white surface, is the white tank bigger than the colors?  I think I saw somewhere that the ink kit would be around $300 to replace, and if you're going through that (and/or a cleaning kit) every few months, that has a pretty high cost of usage.  3) I saw another video about printing on tumblers and cups and it seemed to suggest that the machine was pretty picky about the sizes and shapes of tumblers it works with.  The ones you demo'd appear to be Eufy branded, so not just any old tumbler.  It loses a lot of flexibility if you can only print on their materials.  4) The sticker lamination set up looks like it might require some kind of transfer material, and I'm wondering if that is also proprietary.  I live in Alaska, so I'm really cautious about new tech with proprietary media / materials, because all too often companies don't ship to Alaska or treat it like a completely foreign country.  ($200 to ship a $99 thing - Xtool won't even ship replacement lenses or mirrors to Alaska).  Thanks in advance.","@spetsdod","2025-04-25T19:05:25",0,3

It's not like it's even really making a new image, you're literally feeding it the image you're copying, call it inspiration all you like, but it's just plagiarism with the extra step of telling the computer to do it for you. And frankly, why bother with chatGPT if you're just gonna plagiarize things, you can already do that for free.  As for selling your photos with generated images of your product, I would say that's just false advertising. If you're portraying something as a photo of the product, and it's not a photo of the product, you're just lying, again, with extra steps. And sure, if you want to sell your product by lying, that's hardly a new idea - just ask El Nasir - but let's at least be honest with ourselves about what we're doing here.  Look, man, I'm not entirely against AI being used as a tool. There are even ethically trained AI models out there(even if ChatGPT isn't one of them). But this this isn't helping folks, it's the opposite. It's just a way to have people offload essential - and fairly easy to learn, in my experience - skills for a creative business to a tool they don't control, and ensuring they are turbo-screwed when those tools change or go away, as well as essentially telling people to do sketchy and in some given examples downright unethical things like it's normal and fine.  If you want an example, let's say, hey, someone spun up a business doing portraits of people in Ghibli style using chatGPT...they'd have some angry customers right about now, because in the time between filming and this video being made, ChatGPT has taken that feature offline, with no indication of when it will return. Which is especially ironic, considering Brandon's quite reasonable complaints with hardware about not having it in your control, and a third party being able to shut you down arbitrarily, at any time, with no recourse.  And no, I don't expect this comment to last too long, a few hours at most, whenever Brandon's part of the US wakes up.

"Ugy8VLmFj4MNYp7h07F4AaABAg","Watch This Before Buying a Laser Cutter & Engraver in 2025","Laser diodes are currently limited to about 5W of output power under ideal conditions, which means that any diode laser with a higher power will have multiple diodes. This introduces a problem in that it is very difficult to get all the beams lined up, so the beam is often not very well focused. You will note that I said OUTPUT power. The problem with a lot of diode lasers you might find on Aliexpress or Ebay is that the seller is listing the INPUT electrical power, which is usually about 4 to 5 times the output power. Yep, most of the input power gets turned into heat.   A diode laser with a genuine 40W output will consume a least 160W, and will be turning about 120W of the input power into heat. That's if you actually have a 160W power supply for it. If it doesn't have a massive heatsink, it probably isn't a 40W laser.  So you need to be careful when buying a diode laser, particularly a cheap one from China. Your 40W diode laser is probably only giving you 5W or 10W of actual output power.","@asdf35750","2025-02-27T09:52:07",1,1

This is worth considering when comparing brands. Based on quotes for machines of the same size (1300mm), the OneLaser is about 24% more expensive than the Pronto, claims to be 20% faster, and offers the option of an RF laser. To my knowledge, neither machine uses servo motors like the Thunder Laser. It’s a very capable machine and may have better support than some competitors. However, it’s a new brand with no established track record, although it appears to be closely associated with Thunder Laser, which has a solid reputation.

"UgxsT3UN7l9ncN7J33l4AaABAg","Should You Get an Industrial Size Laser?","I’m really considering this one—the price is amazing for something that’s on par with Trotec or Epilog. Even with shipping, it’s still super competitive compared to most professional lasers out there. What’s even better is that they’re planning to roll out extra features and lifetime upgrade options, which could turn this into the ultimate cabinet CO2 laser. It’s definitely shaping up to be a solid choice.  On the flip side, I’ve never used thunder machine but I had some experience with the OMTECH Pro series, and honestly, omtech services sucks, the speed didn’t match the advertised claims, and the bed would occasionally tilt, causing alignment issues and other issues here and there.—so I’m glad Onelaser stepping it up with a better game.  What I really like about OneLaser is their U.S.-based team. They’re super responsive and actually take the time to answer questions properly, which you don’t see often. The only drawback? You’ve got to wait 2-3 months for inventory, but they’ve promised stock is on the way. Hopefully, they deliver on that soon!","@MakerDaddy","2025-01-15T19:55:57",3,12

Gweike Cloud RF Laser Review","RF lasers are only new for hobby grade machines but is an old standard for sign making lasers and are common among architect model builders. SYNRAD have made CO2 RF lasers since 1984. For detail work it really beats glass CO2 lasers by far. RF lasers can be operated from 0-100% duty cycle and a glass tube laser (10-15)-100%.","@MyllerSWE","2025-01-02T20:13:46",0,0
