Optional full encloser with HEPA filter is a nice option for the fumes. Just saying if you want a 10 watt laser this might be a cool alternative for you. Not affiliated with snapmaker btw..  but just saying.",

I’m a newbie with no knowledge of what they do, what I can do with them or how I can make income to justify the cost. I want to go with my third machine first. I don’t want to buy one only to realize I need a bigger one etc. I also don’t want to buy industrial only to get bored with producing products. I don’t mind spending 20-25K setting up shop with tools that I will need to do the work correctly. I do have a bunch of carpenter tools for rough work but nothing really for finish work. So I will continue my research in what tools I will need to enter into this field. Now having said that, I am impressed so far with the Glowforge Pro Laser Cutter. Will that be my first purchase? I don’t know. I want to check out your other reviews as well as other folks reviews on the different brands. I will also be looking if someone did a video on complete tools to setup a shop needed. This machine sounds pretty simple and that’s good for an old guy like me. If you have any suggestions or links I will check them out. Thank you.",

As recently as 9 months ago, xTool was heavily promoting their D1 and D1 Pro lasers, yet if one visits their site now, ALL of the replacement parts are \"out of stock\", and none of the laser heads can be replaced, with the exception of the $1,200 40w head for the D1 Pro.\n\nSo if your machine breaks, be aware you cannot get parts to repair it. This seems to be true for all xTool products, and I think a 2 year (maximum) service life is preposterous for a tool at this price-point.",

Cant use cameras, no auto focus and I have to manually put in stats of my cut material each time.  It sucks.  Pretty much have to use the Xtool software which is nowhere near as good as Lightburn!  I'm considering getting the Polar instead.",
