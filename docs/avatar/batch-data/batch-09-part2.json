    "text": "Why are galvo lasers not used on a gantry?  it seems like galvo = small work area but fast travel, gantry = slow but big work area. why not do a galvo head on a gantry to get a large work area and a wider (not directly downward) beam on a gantry?  If the galvo head is coupled to a wire source (or other pump configuration), the galvo head should be easily movable relative to the diode bank (my understanding is that fiber optic fibers/wires/cables are flexible and durable).  if the gantry could move the galvo head over a large area, that might also mitigate the other con of galvo heads you mentioned (sub optimal angles at limits of galvo head), because the galvo head wouldn‚Äôt need to be pushed to reach as far to yield a work area that seems competitive (it could stay within an optimal angular range relative to the travel of and on the gantry).  I‚Äôm not currently working in the laser industry so I apologize if this a dumb question.",

We had the new machine for 2 months. Nothing but problems with it. It wouldn't cut on normal settings. It also would start randomly not cutting or excessively burning on higher settings. Finally glowforge sent a \"referbished\" replacement for our brand new 5000$ machine. The refer machine showed up with cooling liguid leaked all over. Tried running the machine at glowforge support request & the entire laser arm is off center running crooked & is completely noisy because the track wheels are worn.\nI highly recommend no one buy a glowforge. Their customer service sucks & there is zero product support. Their poor business model is a devistating model for your business if you are trying to run 9ne with glowforge.",

I will say that since seeing them introduce the subscription service and push it so hard, I've had the constant sneaking worry that one day they'll try and lock all function of my glowforge behind a paywall, but so far they haven't done that.  I only ever upload designs so I have no need for the subscription.  If they ever do decide to brick it for a subscription (or go under and their webclient ceases to be), I'll look at other companies, but I can't afford to upgrade as long as I've got a working laser already.\n\nDespite my overall very positive experience with glowforge, I don't think I'd recommend them to someone now, when you can get a more powerful laser that can run in house software for less money.  When it was 2k, it was also one of the only really user friendly lasers on the market, and one of the cheapest lasers.  At twice the price, and still locked into glowforge's online software, I just don't see why anyone would pick it over a competitor.",

The only thing I disagree with in your video is the \"Omtech has great technical support.\"  In my actual experience, every issue is responded to (in emails - no return calls) is to clean everything and refocus the machine.  In fact, they didn't even read my email, which asked about being able to buy the on/off pushbutton switch that is sticking, and their response was to ignore me.  I asked to pay for a service call.  At this point I have actually convinced two people to buy a competitors model and I am working on my third person.  I purchased the laser and requested support from the Anaheim California location, but I have not seen anything to let me know that the entire company is not represented by the same lousy service.  I would be fine with their lack of help, but even when I asked if there was anyone who could help, I was met with silence.  I was finally able to find someone who does service for Laser in LA, and I was happy to pay for the help.  I am very disgusted with Omtech's complete lack of service.  If you are going to buy a laser, try to find someone who has and uses one.  Service / Customer Service / repair is very hard to find.",

It would not even detect the dot pattern unless I opened the lid part way.  It seemed like Lightburn doesn't like the 180 pano camera lens, but this is my first machine with a camera.   I'll fiddle more tomorrow.",
