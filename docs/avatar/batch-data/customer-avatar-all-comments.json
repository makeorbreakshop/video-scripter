    "comment_text": "If you focus on the ground instead of the horizon, you will see an obvious distortion in several places on the lens, particularly at 2x speed. The fluctuation in the horizon is slight, but also apparent. The horizon does appear to have a curve later in the video, but the math is wrong on the curve based on the distance and current globe calculations, so we can assume that any fluctuating horizon is due to how the lens focuses the picture. The horizon is more steadily horizontal on the flight up, though again with slight fluctuating along the line. Another detail is that the horizon always stays at eye/lens level and never falls/curves away, indicating an ongoing plane (flat area) of Earth and not a rounded shape of Earth. Interesting to note is that there are no stars and there is no moon at this height.  To burn any assumptions, I'm neither a flat earther nor a round earther (nor any other shape earther). These items were interesting, so I thought to mention to them.",

    "comment_text": "I actually have a CO2 laser that cuts metal. I imported a full size 4x8 table from China. It has two heads. I only paid $8500\n\nThe key to being able to cut metal is POWER. You need your laser tube to be rated at 180w (peak) with 150w nominal. So don't only get a 150w tube and think you've got enough power. (Maybe for super thin sheet metal) The way you can find out if the laser you are looking at can even begin to cut metal, is the head. They are significantly more chunky, look industrial. But they are known in the biz as \"Metal/Non-Metal\" heads. That's the phrase you are looking for. My table came with a water chiller, up/down front half table, 2 blower motor fume extractors, extra honeycomb top, rotary attachment and small aquarium pump. But I'm using a silent air compressor, it barely needs any real PSI above 40 anyway. And believe it or not, all of it runs on a 120v. (Even though I just converted the actual table to 220v, so I'm not tripping breakers running the water chiller, blower fans and an air compressor all at once. I had to do the extension cord thing across the shop for awhile to catch different outlets not on the same circuit)\n\nMore about the head I use to cut steel with... It can cut up to 4mm mild steel and 3mm stainless. Which is crazy to think about, considering the price point. The other thing you will absolutely need is a bottle of oxygen from a welding supply store. You only need to use that when cutting steel. So it's a minor cost factor even if you are just messing around. The other benefit of that particular head is that it can also cut 1\" thick acrylic, with glassy smooth polished edges. The secondary head I mentioned, I only use really for cutting thin stuff, most mostly engraving. I believe that one is rated at 80w peak.",

    "comment_text": "Okay, I find your video both informative and misleading. you mention the TOP laser engravers, However, you do not mention that they are all \"Hobby Lasers\" and not professional engravers. Nor are any of them ever mentioned in the major trade publications like Engravers Journal.  There you will see article and advertisements for the true top laser engravers. that said I have a big problem with Full Spectrum Laser.  Having done business with both Trotec and Epilog  and having been involved with a number of different types of laser, I find FSL to be the worst company in the business that I know of.  I had a Muse engraver back in 2016. Having had better machines and knowing that the Muse was only a Hobby Laser, I still found it to be a big problem. Files would not load, the Claim that corel draw files were fully compatible a joke. Having a BS in Computer Information Systems (programming major) It was clear the first day that the software had serious flaws. The design part of the software would not even display properly. Some of the tools were partly hidden and there was no way to make them display or usable. The few things that I was able to draw would not save and be available in the main window. The machine itself was flimsy and the cheaply built. Mirrors were not aligned and not easy to align. The claim FSL advertised back in 2016 that the Muse does not need to be connected with the internet to work was a marketing ploy to try to get sales that might have gone to Glowforge. Bottom line here is the claim that the Muse did nt need to be connected to the internet is both true and misleading.  The true part is that the muse can be operated while not connected to the internet. What thye don;t say much about is the fact that you do have to have an internet connection and have the Muse connected to the internet and turned on. FSL sends updates to the Muse all the time. If your machine is not connected it does not receive the updates. History since 2016 has shown that many muse owners that had machines that worked one day found that their Muse would not work at all the next day (After FSL had sent an update).  FSL lies about capabilities of their machines. They advertised that a materials database would be into the Muse. It said that on their web site and I verified it with my salesman before buying. No Muse has ever had the materials database. After I made a fuss on several Facebook forums Full spectrum Laser removed any mention that the Muse was to come with the database.  My first Muse bluescreened the second morning I had it. I let FSL talk me into a replacement machine. Thy lied about that too. First they said that if I would let them send me a replacement machine they would ship it out that same day. And they claimed it would be fully tested and working as advertised. However, that is not what happened at all. FSL waited until my first machine got back to them. Second, the second machine had the exact same problems as the first one. There 30 day 100% refund policy is something they run from. If you call tech support they will try to help you. that is as long as you go along whit what they offer. As soon as you tell them that you want to return your machine for a refund, they stop responding to you completely. Lucky for me I was persistent. I called multiple times a day and send emails several times a day. No response for 8 days. When I did get someone to talk to me he informed me that they would not pay the return shipping. Had I bought a machine and then just decided that I did not want it, that would have been reasonable. However, when you get a machine that clearly has major problems and will not work as advertised they should pay for the return shipping. So I sent the Muse back at a cost to me of $271.73. Then when FSL received the Muse they took more than 30 days before refunding part of my money. Yes, that is correct. They have a restocking fee they take out of your purchase price. Again if i was returning a work machine simply because I did not want it, a restocking fee would be reasonable.  Before I shipped the Muse back I told the at Full Spectrum Laser that I did not think it was right to make the owner of a non working machine be responsible for return shipping and then to add insult to injury charge a restocking fee.  My comments to them were that if they gave me all my money back, I would go away. However, if they did not refund all my money I would make it a point to tell as many people as possible how they do business.  Long story short I lost well over $500 to FLS. The return shipping was $271.73. Then the restocking fee took another $250 of my refund.    The only concession here is I have for my trouble is I did make a fuss on a number of forums. After more than 2 years, I contacted the head guy. we had a phone conversation. At the end of that call FSL did refund my $250 Restocking fee. However, they refused to refund the $271.73 I paid to ship their Muse back to them.  Not to long after returning the Muse I started a fb group called Muse Buyers. There I now have well over 400 members. Some have Muse engravers. Several tried to return their machine for refund. FSL stalled and would not respond to them. once the 30 day refund period ends they will respond but will not take back your machine. To be fair, of the members of my group that own a Muse, a few  have only goo things to say about it. However there are more members that have a Muse that does not work.",

Seems like there's a bunch of improvements over the typical chinese laser, things that you won't see on a spec sheet and might not even appreciate until actually using it (or in my case, using an inferior laser with much to be desired).\n\nI have a now discontinued bodor machine and it's just to subpar. There's a few videos on it but surprisingly, there aren't a lot of in depth reviews on laser cutters of any brand. For example, i can't find any videos going super in depth on trotec machines aside from the content that trotec puts out. Which to be fair, is very good quality.\n\nAnyway some aspects that you don't hear much about:\n\n- bed/table system (positioning, locking or other features)\n- quality of honeycombs (size, shape, material, framing)\n- depth under table and debris collection system if any\n- airflow design\n- air assist system and features\n\nI think the reason is there's a very small crossover between buyers of the more expensive CO2 lasers and content creators. Everyone's busy making stuff.",

I don't know if it works on 1 program or 2 programs or if the vector and raster imaging is within the machine or in inkscape or another program and WHERE to design the stuff i want to design.. or what program to use. SO for a year now...I've been trying to find out information on HOW...to set this thing up and get it going. i'm about ready to kick the damned thing..lmao...like i said...it's frustrating...i can rebuild a 3d printer but can't seem to figure out... what I do..... first on this thing. HELP...if you can...i would appreciate it..or maybe even do a quick video on it...on HOW to set it up and run the software...it would be helpful to a lot of people. thanks bud. theres a british guy on youtube..but that shit is LONG and drawn out.

Reinitializing the laser seems to reset things and then I can go outside of that boundary.",

    "comment_text": "I'm interested to see how you come along with this machine.  I really like mine but I'm inexperienced with laser engraving.  I've had 3d printers for years, so I like small CNC machines like this...   So far, I've mostly been playing around and working ON the machine doing upgrades, not so much WITH the machine, but that's not a complaint and not due to any fault of the machine. It worked 'fine' out of the box. \n\nI wanted to mention the grounding to you though.  They paint the shell before they put the grounding hardware in.  You will likely find that you don't have a good earth ground to shell and it could be very dangerous.  Following advice of others, I removed the washer and ground it bare under the washer.  I also did the same under the PS, but prob was overkill.  I plan to replace the power inlet and 120 plugs on the back because they are garbage.  I also don't like the fact that full line voltage goes all the way to the power switch on the control panel then back down to the PS.  I want to replace the inlet with a better quality unit with dual pole switch built in so there is no voltage inside the control chamber at all when i have my hands in there. I wanted to make sure you and anyone else with one of these knew about the poor grounding since it's a pretty serious safety issue.   Before I fixed it, i did get a pretty decent shock by touching the edge of the sheet metal where the paint was thin.  Some people recommend to run a direct connection to earth ground with its own ground spike. (Do your own research though, I'm not an electrician just trying not to shock myself or burn the house down LOL)\n\nYou do need to get an ammeter in there asap so you can tell what's actually going on with laser power.  You simply connect it between Cathode of the laser tube and the PS.  If the needle moves backward, reverse it\n\nOver all I'm happy with the OM Tech though.  I ordered a different \"K40\" at first.  When it arrived it had been dropped and dented badly so I returned it.  Long story short, the seller was a jerk so I eventually got it refunded by UPS and ordered this machine instead.  I'm glad I did.  This one is much sturdier and just generally better.  I've mostly been learning about the control system so far and upgrading the electronics.  I figure I should understand how it works and get everything working as well as possible before I actually start learning more about laser engraving.  I like to know my machines so I know how to repair them when they break. Like with drones, if you don't build it yourself, what are ya gonna do when ya crash it?? LOL  It's much harder to learn on a machine that isn't up to par.  We all know going in that these machines are good, but need upgrades to be great.  So far, I have mine running Marlin on a SKR1.4t.  With TMC2209s, its super quiet and both drivers and motors stay cool.  Having lots of inputs and outputs gives me lots of options for firmwares or things like Gcode/Macro Button control of case lighting and the red dot.  I'm working on adding a relay board today so I can do the same with air and water pump etc.  I added the smallest gas strut I could find to the door bc I accidentally slammed it shut a couple times lol.  I also ran an LED strip with a micro switch on the control side so it comes on like a fridge when I open the door LMAO.   It has been a bit of a bumpy road with Marlin though, so once I'm happier with my config ans engraving speeds, I'll share it so it's easier for others to use inexpensive boards like this instead of the pricey ones.  I believe Smoothie may even be more appropriate for lightburn and will run on SKR/MKS... Will find out later haha.  I haven't added air assist yet because I'm hesitant to order the wrong pump in effort to save $ and still debating, but it's time so I have to choose a compressor asap.  \n\nI really enjoy your work brother.

I am in search of a laser that can Etch through powder coating. My biggest issue is that the product is large and I would need a pass-through system or some way to Etch in the middle of the product. I have been looking at the Orion Motor Tech 60W, but how do you think that might compare to the FSL Muse Core 2D with Hobby Kit?",

Exporting model to OBJ = up to 5 minutes and more of what cloud computation bullshit. Year 2020. You on decent SSD and wait 5 minutes to just save you model as OBJ. \n2. You are NOT able to change mesh export settings and if you get model with ugly faceted surfaces because of that and you cant render it = there's no solution. \nTHAT level of bullshitness for payed software?

    "comment_text": "I have had my Muse 3D for about eight months now.  As a machine and a piece of hardware I agree with your review:  this is an outstanding machine that looks great, is well designed and solidly built and cuts and engraves extremely well.  As with any complex device, you will encounter difficulties with various things (such as alignment and belt adjustment),  but their customer service has been outstanding and such issues are totally normal with any laser.\n\nMy issue with the Muse is  the software that runs it: re3.  In my hands, this is a horrible piece of software that is slow,  non-intuitive, confusing, constantly freezes my laptop, and is so frustrating to use that I may in fact sell my Muse because of the constant battles I have had with the software. I consider myself proficient with software and have used numerous programs, but at every turn, I have found difficulties with re3.   Interestingly,  re3 looks very similar to Lightburn,  but Lightburn is extremely well designed, intuitive, and  is an absolute joy to use.  It just has a polished \"feel\" and ease of use that re3 totally lacks.  In my opinion, re3 is a high school software project while Lightburn is sleek, professional and easy.  If only re3 were as well \"built\" as the Muse itself this would be an awesome combination. \n\nOne thing I have learned , and one should consider when buying a laser, is that when you purchase a proprietary device such as the Muse or the Glowforge for example, (I don't know anything about the Dremel)  you are totally dependent on the software and interface supplied by the respective companies.  For example, if Glowforge should fold as a company, your laser would be completely useless as it runs only via the company internet.  Although the Muse would not suffer a similar fate as the re3 software is on the machine, if you like re3, great, but if you don't, you are stuck.  So basically, by going with a proprietary machine you are exchanging the convenience of a \"plug and play\" device (obviously a great advantage) but totally giving up any flexibility or controlof the machine  to the respective company.\n\nI sincerely hope FS Laser comes out with a useful re3 update soon.",

    "comment_text": "It seems like perhaps you don't know very much about skechup. Almost everything, not everything, but almost everythig you did in fusion you can do in sketchup. Are you aware of any of the following plugins; curviloft, sub d tools, flowify, soap,  bezier spline, curic stretch, fredo box stretch etc. There are so many plugins in sketchup that are extremely powerful for quick organic manipulation. I think there are some great points about fusion here but it's a poor comparison video because you don't talk about sketchup pro, why just talk about sketchup, sketchup pro is really where the power is, not sketchup because it's about the available plugins that are within sketchup that are incredible. You certainly don't have to go and do things from scratch like you mention in your video. I would say that after watching this and the lack of these comments that I've just mentioned that this video is a poor comparison video and you should perhaps be informed well on both products before you generalize the two together in a comparison because it's very confusing for people like in your comments section who are unsure about which they need for their modelling projects.",

    "comment_text": "Thanks for very informative information, I have autodesk licenses through my company, but not for fusion 360, I have need for others of there CAD software from time to time, they resently changed there network license to personal wich almost trippled my companys anual fee for something I need seldom, but when I need it I need it bad and can't be without it. For my personal use I used sketchup for the last 10 years or, so not realising the time saved with putting effort into parametric design, witch would have saved me alot of time with small changes in the design prosess with limitations of payed version. I am personally no converting to freeCAD and blender to mix my personal use since it is opensource and seems to have strong community. Of what I seen on youtube freeCAD can give me my needs for personal use and much more than I need without worring about license changes. Of cource many non autodesk files have caused problems in work since autodesk recognises that and put problems in import of what should be a standard format. Easier 3D modeling software are good to see what you need, but I wish I found parametric design software alot earlier, learning curve is alot steper, but only after a few models I see the win of making that extra effort. So to summary my thoughts, non parametric designs are if you have simple shapes you want and make one design and stick with it, if you have designs that can change small dimesions made in earlie stage without to mouch work go with parametric. Wiched I gone parametric now many years erlier. My finall thougt is that if you are planning to make future with 3D software and modelling for commersial use and get job in company, yes autodesk is most common and used around the world, but if you are a hobbyist or a small company protect your self about changes in future and look at opensorce prosjekts like freeCAD and Blender. I do pay for licenses when needed, but for non company use I only pay for the licenses needed, I try to keep paying atleast 1/3 to opensorce prosjekts if there is equivalent I can use to support further development. Even as smal programmer I believe that the creator sets the price, big or small creator , if you use product respect license conditions, support what you belive in. My first experience with autodesk I think is about 30 years ago with first computer lessons in architektural computing, autodesk has a stayed on top since then for comersial use along trimples sketchup with promise of free use for hobby , sorry to say I think commercial software as they think they won ground in uff they restrict the free for non commecial use to the  point it's  useless to hobbiest use. even if changes wan't as bad as most makers of youtube made it and thanks for that with your information, that where very informative, I still for personal use look for mor long terme stable solution for you as hobbist, for me it would be easier to keep to one, autodesk do not let me keep my persona fredom as hobbyist and my hobby programs to intergrate with my work at this time. So finalising my thoughts. Yes for work I need to keep up with Autodesk, but for my fredom in private I now fokus for freeCAd and blender, even thou reworking my models from sketchup that I need is a pain, putting alot of effort into lerning software that suddenly changes conditions is a pain, so as coclusion if you read all of this thoughts is,, if your going for learning for work at companies, this is good thing, but as hobbiest for your own use it is better to keep to opensource without restrictions. With my computer being both my personal and working I see complexity in many problems of free and non free versions, but I pay anual taxes for my personal computer and my own computer being the same, the same goes from my telephone that my company pais for and I get taxes for and can't get sirin sevices because of that. If you are new to parametric design I recommend freeCAD and put effort into that, if you plan yor 3D moddeling as work, definitly go with fusion 360. I would surtinality make good thougt about making in freeCAD and 360 videos in future compared to make same in fusion 360, my company gives me licenses if I say I need them without quistion, thats there fault, most licenses could be avoided so investors are at total loss. I do not care about that, if anyone been reading throuhg this it is about proos and con I can think of, there is no simple answer. No english is not my first language, nor do I intend it to be, best regards from Sweden. With all kritics it still the best informative video of fusion 360 autodesk changes in users agrement and priviliges. If anyone gotten throgh my thoughts definitly watch this video and make your desision made of information and need of use",

The bug was still in existence as of January (the last time I forgot and sent something directly to my printer to print full size).  You send something to a printer (full size, everything set correctly to print 1:1), and Fusion prints at something like 93% scale for no reason.  I printed several patterns, used them to cut out the parts I was making, and about 6 hours later I realized everything was undersized.  The workaround was to create a PDF, then print THAT at 1:1 and it works fine.",

Called F.S. and got nothing. They had stopped making the main control board and offered NO assistance. Bought a new power supply and Main processor from Light Object and got machine back up and running. Quite different software to learn, but, now I prefer it. I CAN'T recommend F.S. for their customer service or warranty. Just had to replace an axis driver. Another $50 gone! Please do your OWN research!",

I saw your review of the Ortur, and I can get one with a little more powerful laser. (20W instead of the 15W, which as you pointed out is really like 6 watts vs. 4 watts) Do you think that will do the job? Thank so much!",

For what I am looking to do and for the tiny budget I have it will be the right way to go. I'm upgrading it to a 150w and it's a good size (900x600mm) cutting area. I would love to get into cutting metal but will have to wait until I can afford a fiber cutter I guess. Thanks for the video, helped heaps!",

I am worried about making the same mistake. The poly looked horrible, i think we used a minwax Oil based poly, on top of my Kona Gel stain .. .I think we did the same thing with the stain i didnt let it sit long enough and wiped to much off. it looked nice in the begging but the next day it was faded quit a bit. But it wasn't that bad., WE covered it with some poly and it was horrible looking made it look faded even more??? no idea why? I put down a the butcher block oil on the butcher block before staining not a oil based pre stain. I have no idea but i am looking for idea on what to cover my stain with, i do NOT LIKE POLY at all. It was so plastic looking and showed so much flaws along with looking cloudy. .",

    "comment_text": "nice review....when $ is no object....My advice for anyone is read reviews and watch a lot...a lot of videos. Then so you dont throw your $ in the ocean....buy a K40 laser. Ya i know, its chinese, its unsafe, etc, etc..... you dont have to be a rocket scientist with these....i bought one on amazon, did a tweek here and there. I use inkscape (free)....and scorchworks (free) to use this K40 laser, and it works great....dont have to deal with chinese software.... you learn alot, the cost is super minumum.... if you dont like it, or you get bored with it, sell it on craigslist for  $200....lesson learned.\nsooooo. to wrap things up.....Couple years ago, i built my own. bigger and better c02 laser and still using free software. Cost me $1500 to make, and i have more than made up the cost to make it.....life treating me fine right now....retired. Learned off the K40, reading reviews, watching you-tube videos......then make your own.....cant tell you how many people have made their own.....a ton.",

I wouldn't put boss anywhere near epilog. \nFor general use CO2 lasers I would do a list like this:\n- K40 + upgrades\n- 50W ebay/ali chinese\n- 80W ebay/ai chinese\n- All in ones or what you call kickstarter lasers (including the more expensive dremel brand one)\n- Branded chinese lasers with local support (boss, thunder, aeon etc)\n- Finally top tier RF lasers (epilog, trotec, ULS etc)\nThere's plenty of specific machines that fall outside those categories. Like aeon having an 'all in one' style series and thunder laser having RF source lasers.",

I use it for plans to accompany my videos and for client pitches to give everyone a clear understanding of exactly what will be produced. Now that I’m somewhat proficient in sketchup, of course, they make the announcement that it will no longer be free in the near future, so it seems like Fusion will be the way to go. I’ve heard a few folks plugging your new 360 course and since folks who get my plans won’t even be able to view the models for free, it’s looking like I’ll be making the switch in the near future.",

For example, your bit on mirroring the table legs, I was following along and found mine wouldn't work - I got \"Compute failed\" and \"One or more patterns could not be intersected...\" etc. I googled it and found it's because you've got to change Pattern Type from \"Faces\" to \"Components\" in the mirror window. You have it selected (likely by default) but didn't mention it to us absolute beginners :P.",

Only problem with this is if I change parameters for sizing, the parts don't get moved to the correct location. Is there a way around this?",

I also think what most people miss out on is that those Lasers don't just pose a threat to your sight when looking into the Laser with line of sight but they also pose an issue with reflections ( light bouncing off a mirror ) and refractions ( shining a strong flashlight _through_ your hand ). Besides THAT there's also the issue with cutting certain materials - Laser cutting ABS, as an example, will emit Cyanide!",

Tried everything and apparently the laser itself has failed so I attempted to contact support at GearBest. This is where it has gone terribly wrong - they simply do not respond to requests of any kind. Is that because of Covid19? Don't think so as I could live chat with them, they are sending out advertising emails, and there is nothing on their site about the Coronavirus. So, the live chats end with \"you will be contacted in this regard in 24 hours or less\" which I have been told on three separate occasions and received nothing. Opened tickets on their support site are closed without any followup within a day or two and sent emails that go unanswered. \n\n\nNice.\n\n\nSo I would stay away from this product and GearBest.com at all costs and just spend the extra money on a real laser engraver rather than this junk from China. You get what you pay for.\n\n\nBTY, I submitted a dispute to my credit card company and they have refunded my money - even they couldn't make contact with this outfit.",

If you decide to sand in between finishes, make sure to also use something that's ultra fine like 400 grit. Also do it within 24 hours of taking the wrapping off.",

I can get quite a bit done. Sketch-u-cam helps a lot. It's a bit limited and buggy too.\n\nIt's a bit early in the game but F360 looks quite promising. I'm already doing things in it that would be completely hairy in sketchup.\n\nI'm going to argue that Sketchup is great at the beginning since you can get going pretty fast with it and there's a reasonable gamut of stuff you can do with it using a 2.5D methodology. Great for the dating stage with your cnc machine. \n\n\nBut if you are going to marry your cnc machine a person should add F360 to the mix. You'll be able to delve deeper.",

    "comment_text": "Some nice information! However, I'm still not convinced... Lots of the stuff you showed like resizing the countertop and drawer can be done very quickly in Sketchup as well. I see all these tables and screens full of dimensions and numbers, but I think with some experience you will be faster in Sketchup in the end, since it's so easy to use.\n\n\nFor the organic sculpting there are very good and simple to use plugins for Sketchup. And as for printing, Sketchup can export directly to STL as well, I use it for 80% of my printer modeling (and some blender sometimes). The built-in slicer in Fusion is cool, but if you're used to a normal slicer like Cura or Slic3r already, this doesn't have much more value over using Sketchup.\n\n\nAbout rendering...  I actually use Sketchup for this professionally,  with a plugin called Twilight Render. It may not be as powerful as for example Vray ( which also costs an insane amount of money), but it can make REALLY realistic renders, better than anything i've seen coming out of Fusion.\n\n\nNow... I'm not saying that Fusion is bad; If you want to do some complex and organic modeling and product design, though it can be done, it's not very easy in Sketchup. For extremely parametric stuff, like the lego bricks you showed us, this will be better as well. But I still think people really write off Sketchup too quickly, and often overlook what that piece of software can do with some additional plugins, ESPECIALLY for interior design and non-organic stuff like that. The workflow and interface sure are infinitely more intuitive and simple than any other modeling software out there...\n\n\nYou're free to use what you want of course, both are valid options, but don't underestimate Sketchup if you like a really hands-on and intuitive workflow.",

Run pure distilled water only and put a couple drops of dish detergent and a cap full of bleach in it.  If you don't want to use bleach, then at least add fish tank bio killer in the water to prevent it from going stagnant over time.  Using antifreeze or \"water wetter\" products and the like is bad, because it cooks into the glass and actually will eventually build heat on the tube, as will minerals in the water if it's not pure distilled.  Don't listen to these dopes.  I've been running home built units for years now and have done the research for 10 men.\nAlso invest in a CW-5000 chiller and be done with it.  Doing anything less is asking for future issues in all reality.",

Do you think this could cut through 8 oz leather and how well do you think it would hold up cutting out leather patterns for wallets, bags, key chains, and the like?",

    "comment_text": "Also, worth noting, those included glasses aren't rated for the laser on the machine. The tint vs color of the laser is a dead giveaway. If you look at any laser engraver and many high powered laser pointers of similar wavelength, the protective shielding or goggles are orange. It's basically a principle of opposing colors. It helps if you think of the color of the goggles cancelling out the color of the laser. In this case, the blue laser light is extremely close to the green goggles on the color wheel. The goggles let light in and around the green wavelength through. For the goggles to be effective in blocking the blue laser light, they should be red, or preferably orange, the opposing color to blue. \n\nSince they aren't clear or blue goggles, they are probably blocking some of the harmful light, but I definitely wouldn't trust my vision to them, especially if they were included free with a cheap and cheerful, safety measure delete laser engraver.\n\nEdit: It might be worse than I thought...I was just basing this off of a combination of my knowledge of optics, confirmed by the high end laser related products I've seen. I just looked it up and found this video. It looks like he has a pair of the included glasses, and they fail to even block an LED, so if you're staring at the laser light, you're probably roasting your retinas.\nhttps://youtu.be/upCsVrKrW7M\n\nHe also has an epic accent.\n\nEdit 2: Here's a video that goes more into depth on what you should look for in goggles to protect yourself. I am pretty confident that the ones included above are just green plastic, with no laser rating whatsoever. If one is listed, I'd be willing to bet that it's utter BS.\n\nLong and short of it, if you're gonna save a buck on your laser engraver, don't skimp on the PPE to go along with it. Or you'll be giving yourself anti-lasik.\n\nFinal Edit: I'm also only considering the harmful potential of the unshielded laser module. This is ignoring the carcinogen laden fumes it's outputting. There is a reason laser cutters are enclosed both behind laser shielded material AND have their own filtration and extraction systems. This could also very easily start a fire if you're not watching it like a hawk, and even if you are, I can see a mosquito fart knocking it over, or it overshooting the material it's engraving and scorching the surface beneath it. \n\nAs much as I want a laser cutter, this seems like a bad idea. 3d printers and CNC routers are one thing to downsize and lose all the safety gear. The damage they can do is pretty limited to localized burns and possibly losing a digit to a router bit. Laser cutters are next level dangerous.",

    "comment_text": "I'm about to say something that will make the wood movement police go crazy. But whatever. Lol. My experience supports it. \n\nWood movement... It's a \"common tale\" that as external humidity changes, so will your projects... Well... That's honestly not the case if you have your home well insulated and at a consistent humidity. Which most houses are. Most antique furniture doesn't break from wood movement when sitting in a house.... They break from wood movement when people put them in garages and barns where there is no climate control. Then the wood movement starts setting in and everything gets all crazy. And also .. wood movement can be overpowered and controlled. Just look at high quality sheets of veneer ply. \n\nIf you are building something for an interior job, honestly it will likely shrink a little over the next 1-6 months when bringing it in from your shop (especially if your shop isn't well controlled with it's humidity and temperature .)\n\nI've sold very expensive veneered signs, laminated chess boards with highly figured cross grain, and even tables with cross grain on them. As long as you expect a little shrinkage and it's gonna be climate controlled.... You honestly don't need much for wood movement. \n\nYou don't believe me? Go to the Las Vegas airport and go to the Jamba Juice inside the terminal. There is a hickory table there with no proper breadboards, held all together with glue and dominos. Breaks all the rules and it's perfectly flat and strong with perfect joints. \n\nAlso, the Samurai Carpenter and many of my fellow pro woodworker friends agree with me. Yes wood moves. But not as much as people think on indoor furniture. And a little known fact about wood glue.... It's actually not a true solid once cured. It can allow for a surprising amount of wood movement and shifting and still keep it's bond. Honestly man you could have just glued and mortise and tenoned that baby on for the breadboard. The bigger issue isn't the breadboard... It's the fact that you are using construction lumber. The 2x6s are gonna get way more contraction than just going down to the hardwood store and buying poplar. And it actually will be surprisingly similar in cost. But the moisture in that framing lumber may be enough that it blows that a perpendicular wood joint out. But if you are using dry high quality woods... My statement stands.",

Given the price level of these things are built to it's also entirely possible for the laser to just go into high power mode on its own to do some sort of circuitry or programmatical failure.\nA good quality set of laser goggles is probably the most important thing you can buy when dealing with anything laser.

For cutting thicker materials it also gets in the way because there's only a 2mm gap at optimal surface focus.\n\nI made a temporary enclosure out of cardboard and piped in a 170cfm (advertised flow) exhaust blower. It's not ideal or the safest enclosure material, but I never leave the laser unattended when in operation and have a small ABC extinguisher nearby. The blower is marginal for extracting the smoke, but that's likely due to the \"enclosure\" having an open front.\n\n\nMine is good to etch at faster than 9000, but at those speeds I haven't tested the accuracy. For slate coasters, it will even produce a textured surface at medium speeds.",

    "comment_text": "I received this laser this week and I have to say it is a sexy POS.  They say it works now with lightburn, well it does not.    I have had nothing but problems with it.  It crashes into the wall all the time.  When you tell it to home, it crashes into the wall.  If you try to frame your work to tell where you need to put you material, it crashes into the wall.  There are no limit switches on this laser so it has no idea where it is.  If you want to put your work in the middle of the field, well good luck.  I tried everything and it would only work in the upper left corner.  There is no emergency stop switch, so if you have a problem you have to fumble  around for the power switch.  Not something you want to do if you have a real problem.  I ordered the rotary with this laser but did not get it.  I had to contact support to find out that it was on backorder, and they never even thought to email me to let me know.  There is no factory air assist with this laser, and that would defiantly come in handy.  Their setup video is horrible.  It moves so fast that you can't really tell what they are doing and what part that are using.  I have to say DON'T buy this if you are new to laser engraving, and even if you are a seasoned  person it will be hard to get it to work properly.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from this laser.  Sorry to put this up but I think it will help a lot of people.  This is not a well thought out machine. Yeah it looks sexy and well built but it's not worth the price at all.  I will be getting an Ortur for sure.\nI do think that you can learn a lot from this channel though.  He really seems to know his stuff.  Keep the videos coming, and thank you for all you do for this hobby.",

    "comment_text": "I would love to hear your advice actually\r\nI've been looking at your videos now for quite a while because I am getting more and more interested in buying my own laser cutter. I have a lot of experience with MDF as well as resin printers. Even before I used to go to the city workshop where I operated with their CO2 Laser (HyperCUT 6090 PRO).\r\n I can print a lot of things with my printers but still I would love to be able to cut and engrave stuff.. + with wood you get that warmer feeling if you give some sort of gift. I would love to have a machine that is capable of cutting good as well as engraving. Mostly I would cut some sort of stands and smaller chests or boxes for storage or decoration. material wise; Foam, MDF, acrylic and vinyl. So with this cutter it's really, really tempting. Price is fair, even though I was always in love with Co2 lasers and dreaming about getting one because of speed and enclosure and everything else. I also looked at some of your other videos like OM Tech K40 and its bigger 50w brother but with K40 the problem is cut volume and with 50w machines the problem is price. So if you were in my position, which machine would you recommend me getting? Should I save up the money and buy bigger CO2 for like 1500 - 2000€ or should these smaller diode machines work well enough for me? Thank you for your answer!!",

A $3k glowforge is stupid for home use, I'm gonna just cute paper or something that i'll be using it once a week. It's cheaper just to buy the product. But that $500 K40 is nice...can't wait until I have more room hopefully the price will cut in half. Maybe creaty will get into laser cutter.",

The earlier version works when you try to position the laser using the buttons to go left, right, up or down.  On the new release, it seems to be very harsh on the motors and the laser starts moving diagonally (not in a straight line) as intended.  Again, the software is beta release at best.",

I was thinking it's more along the line of two 20w lasers equaling 40w... What do you think?\n\nOne another note I saw the video of the big machine you bought from China and my wife and I agree it's a good option. We were just curious how much was your shipping and freight once it got to a US port?",

They only sell the LU2-4 LF by itself.\n\nIt would be nice if they sold the machine with the option to get all three modules with it, which is what I want. As of now I would have to choose between LU2-2 or LU2-2 SF and then buy the LU2-4 LF by itself. I would basically be missing out on one of the other modules which sort of sucks if you want all three.",

Remove the internal ducting and you have really good extraction.\nThis means that you will only be spending around $100 for air assist and mirrors to get a very workable machine that competes with the Glowforge on most jobs.",

    "comment_text": "Very informative reviews. One note: You have the endemic YouTuber problem. Not as bad as most but still pretty irritation. You wave and flail things you are holding as if we should look at them, but we can't. Check when you \"show\" the piece of basswood. You would not flip and wave it in the face of a friend would you? Part of this is also the wild arm wavings and gesticulations like you are doing a rap concert. I bet you do not do that in person either, or maybe people just stand well back to avoid injury. This breaks the personal experience of the video and gives some \"This Old House\" vibe (meaning poorly scripted, over acted). Basically you act like you are speaking to an audience, but you are not. On YouTube you are speaking one-on-one. Just my 2 cents. Keep up the good work.",

Could someone please advise me on the laser control software? My drawings are being done in Inkscape and that's coming out fine but I'm a bit unsure as to what laser control software I ought to be thinking about. For example, I don't know whether \"K40 Whisperer\" (which seems like it would meet my needs) can be used with these larger machines. Any advice that gets me from Inkscape drawings to the cut would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance :o)",

The only thing missed in this video is discussing how some sellers of diode lasers mislead buyers by specifying the power used by the diode rather than it's actual optical (cutting/engraving) power. As an example, I have another diode laser that is sold as a \"15W\" laser but actually puts out around 4.5 watts of cutting/engraving power. 15 watts is the amount of power it requires from a power supply.",

Mostly on wood, but i would like to have open option to engrave on metal, it doesnt need to be deep, just enough to not be wiped off. I would like to buy if possibly around 700$. But i will work a lot on that laser and i need it to work long term. Do you reccomend atomstack x7 50w dual laser? I also looked at ortur laser master 2 pro, but as i saw it is weak to cut through even 5mm wood. What do you think about x7 and if not can you reccomend me something else. I cant get xtool d1 shipped to my country(Serbia). And is it better to order from aliexpress or from official site, because sometimes the difference in price is arond 50-100$. By the way i love your videos, they are very detailed. Sorry for the gramatical errors my english isnt the best.",

They claim it can cut 6mm Basswood in one pass. My main use for a laser is cutting through 1.5mm hardwood (.062) of different species (Maple, Cherry, Walnut, etc). If you ever have a chance to check out that capability, I'd lover to know how it goes. I have a Glowforge now, but when it dies, I'd love to find a cheaper alternative. Thanks again for the detailed laser reviews!",

    "comment_text": "The software that is shipped with the LaserPro is buggy and and not very powerful. LaserPro is not compatible with Lightburn - yet - they are working on it. However after several weeks playing with it, I found that with a very simple GCODE header and footer added to the Lightburn configuration file, the LaserPro will (mostly) run with Lightburn. It has a very small spot and is very powerful. It easily cuts 3mm plywood at 225mm/min at 95% power, and engraves literally everything. It has an internal fan that provides air assist, blowing air from the same orifice as the laser, and the lens is recessed in the laser head so smoke does not settle out on the lens. The auto focus works great, and the enclosure with the fan lets you vent the smoke out a window. The video camera takes a bit of careful setup but is extremely useful. When the LaserPro is fully Lightburn compatible it will definitely be the diode laser engraver to buy. My LaserPro is now the one I use for all my projects, and my previous laser engraver (which I was very happy with) sits pretty much idle.",

The big thunder we have has like a 3ft × 4.5ft cutting area which seems insane, but one thing we have noticed with it is that the laser's cutting power gets weaker as you move away from the source, so you can't really utilize the full cutting area as easily.  That's probably just as issue with such a large laser, so keep that in mind.  Still an awesome machine and I love being able to get my hands on that pro grade stuff",

Eithers' most difficult and frequent use case would be for a teacher cutting paper, cardboard, and occasional thin (6mm or less basswood/balsawood) for young student projects. Along with doing engraving for gifts and occasional sales (once or twice a year flea markets, no online shop).  Would a 4\" hose and exhaust fan to outside *near* the xTool be enough in a basement shop? I've got preexisting 4\" exhausts running for airbrush and resin 3d printers. Or should we really use an enclosure?  Really like the xTool build quality and what seems to be a better laser module with dual diode. \"Good enough\" software doesn't seem to be a problem since it doesn't need a persistent online connection like glowforge. The big thing that has me hesitating on this xTool is that the Ortur has an optional enclosure, seems to have more reviews, more mods, and more units actually out there in the hands of hobbyists.",

Perhaps include a quickie on how to get dimensioned 2D drawings along with the nice model?  Its a pretty simple thing to do, and would be critical for anyone needing this to construct the table.  For my class, I have every student submit a set of pdf's along with the f3d model that show top, front and side views with all important dimensions labeled, or I take points off their projects...this one should also include an exploded view of the joints you made. \n\nGood video though!",

    "comment_text": "Good video, however just about everything you said sketchup cant do.....it can. For one, model using dynamic components. You can not only change sizing on the fly but you can also animate door openings, drawers and check for collisions etc. This is HUGE! You can change material thickness etc. Rendering....well, that depends on what you are trying to accomplish. Sketchup uses companies like VRay and Lumion..... Fusion 360s internal renderer cant compare. That does require an additional software purchase, but being that was a point brought up I assume we are focusing on quality of render potential and Vray simply cant be touched. One huge advantage Sketchup has over Fusion 360 is Layout, the quality and ease of use to create amazing drawings is a big need for me. Again both of these programs are solid, it just depends on what you are doing and what you need. I would not count sketchup out as it is very powerful, and even more so when paired with quality plugins. I do like Fusions CAM capability though, I currently export to Aspire, but 3d shapes would\n be nice to toolpath on screen like that. Thanks for the video!",

    "comment_text": "The ORTUR looks like it be good for some DIY 3D printer, with some modifications.\n\nI worked at a place that used a type of plastic powder, in the consistency of baby powder. Wile sitting in it's shaker, it looked like bubbling liquid. Wile in that state, it is sucked up with a positive charge added to it, and sprayed on a metal part with a negative charge, to make the powder paint stick to it. After, it goes into an oven to melt the plastic onto the metal as a covering. Comes in many colors.\n\nIf one was to have a table that a slider arm will lay out a thin layer of that powder onto a table, the ORTUR could be use to trace out the shape of one layer to a 3D part. The table would drop by one layer, as the slider arm adds another layer of powder. The ORTUR traces out that next layer, before the table drops again. Repeat, until all layers are complete.\n\nUse a small vac to suck up the unused powder, and you got a 3D part. Trick is, getting the ORTUR to be part of that automated task. Could be make possible with a Raspberry PI I think.\n\nWould prove to be a neat project. And cost vastly less than other 3D printers that do such already costing over 15,000 for a low end 3D printer of that type.",

I also expanded the bed area by cutting down the exhaust shroud. I did run through a major tune-up and alignment to really dial everything in before use. I didn't bother with a chiller, a 5-gallon bucket serves me just fine. I also haven't bothered to upgrade the controller board, the original works just fine for my workflow with K40 Whisperer. I mainly use it for cutting plastic or plywood parts for prototyping rather than engraving, so the stock controller is fine. All in, it easily came in under $800 to have a very versatile machine in my arsenal that I can add and upgrade to later if needed.",

If you use it out of this range the module will fail within months. Btw. even the good cheap china fiberlaser modules on these machines are RFL-P20QE versions with have a range of 20-60kHz.

Back then you connected to it, as a printer, so Epilogue provided a print driver. Being older it had no USB, so it has a parallel printer port connector. But I \"printed\" thru Corel Draw, which would both cut and engrave. The engraving portion, was provided with a simple image file format (.jpg, .png, .bmp, etc), and the cutting with a vector format (.dxf), that I imported into corel, to make the final file, to be engraved & cut out. Is this still an option on modern engravers ? The prices on these new units are hobby affordable, as Epilogue units start around $20K, so not going to happen, unless you're in the business.",

They get hacked your laser burns down your house. You lose internet for any reason you have a brick until you get service restored. They will someday say we want a monthly fee for you to use your laser, you will have no choice but to pay. That is the only reason for their design choice of no offline usage, you will be forced sooner than later to pay a monthly subscription to use your machine. Anybody who says different is a liar.

Having been screwed by a company going out of business, turning my 3d printer into a brick, I will never buy tools like these that require an online service (as opposed to web-based software served up from the tool, like most routers). For the price of something like the glowforge, I'd want to ensure I could use it for as long as I decide to.\n\nProprietary software (that they eventually stop updating) is another no-no, but at least you can work around that by keeping a frozen PC around for the life of the tool. No way to work around a service requirement, though.",

Water flow using supplied pump and distilled water are fine, although the rubber tubing supplied is crap and folds readily, with a series of clothes pegs, I have been able to press it open along full length providing no restriction to water flow. Power switches on and off to the machine okay, emergency stop working fine, temperature LCDs and Power LED working fine, as are the adjustment buttons. No damage to the box it came in or obvious damage inside, laser tube is watertight ie no cracks visible and no leakage. Set laser power to 30% following instructions in the instruction manual for mirror alignment on mirror 1, set masking tape across mirror  1 and pressed the pulse button. Result - no laser beam, and no burn on the centre of masking tape. Tried beam switched on constant, still no purple laser beam in the tube (as appears at time point 1.20 on the video) or burn on paper. I have tried increasing and decreasing power and temperatures in the tube have remained about 28 degrees C.\nMy machine does not appear to have a flow switch, having pulled the tubes both ways in the casing to their full possible extent. Is there anything else I need to do or can try other than sending it back to the supplier for a refund?",

    "comment_text": "I didnt hear much about the speed of the glow forge in your review.  Personally, I think it is painfully slow. when I first started looking for a laser, I saw reviews just like this, and got all fired up and excited.  however, after digging deeper, checking out the specs, comparing this to others on the market, and then factoring in the total lack of actual support ( other than the community forums ), having to return the unit to even replace a tube, and for almost every other things, at. great cost - I soon realised, this was actually not a great machine for the money they are demanding for it.  It looks very nice, but, it just doesn't command the price.  \n\nthey do an excellent job of marketing, an immense job, but they they would ( in my opinion ) provide a much better product, with support if they pent less on the advertising and more into the product itself.  Once I made an initial enquiry, I was almost hounded by e-mail after e-mail after e-mail.  however when I replied with questions, their answers were always very vague, or often they would deviate from my question, paying lip service to it only, and trying to big up everything else in an attempt to negate my concerns, and convince me that despite my concern, there were so many other aspects that were simply amazing...anyway... hard pass for me im afraid\n\nI love your reviews in general, but I do have to say, I think this one was probably biased as a result of glow forge sending you the laser and air purifier etc..I know you said it wasn't, but it did sound like it.",

Got Lightburn when I had the Ortur and was a simple process to upgrade the license to work with the Ruida controller on the 60w machine.  Makes for an amazingly capable machine with plenty of power for my current goals.\n\nI don't think there's anyway I'd be satisfied with a Glowforge.  Proprietary software, internet connection required, and could become a brick any day if the company ever shut down.\n\nNote: Ortur machine sold on Facebook Marketplace within 24 hours for about what I paid for it (of course I included all my upgrades so it was certainly more valuable than stock).",

Just ask any Cricket user of the last couple of months.  Yes, Cricket backed out of their proposed changes, but for a while, there was the potential to basically owning a brick..  Should Glowforge find itself in financial difficulties, what is to stop them from charging for functionality that already exists and is part of the package, or jacking up the cost of their subscription service, after people have integrated the glowforge into their process (if commercial).

    "comment_text": "The reviewed equipment adds up to basically $7000. A quick look at OMTech shows you can get 100w, 24x40 (and passthrough), autofocus, a much deeper maximum depth (tumbler engraving anyone?), an actual chiller, two different styles of rotary machines, Corel graphics suite, and Lightburn for $6360. You'll have $640 left to spend on a camera for Lightburn so you'll have the same functionality as SlowForge. You'll also have a much bigger machine with more than twice the power and the ability to fix small things like laser alignment (good luck re-aligning your shiny new Glowforge if it gets bumped during shipping). The only thing you'll be missing is the air purifier and there are plenty of cost effective options out there.\n\nGlowforge shouldn't be compared to a cheap k40; it should be compared to what else you can get for the cost. For the cost, there are much better options.\n\nBtw, their $3000 basic machine gets equally spanked by a 50w OMTech. They do have great advertising though and the entire laser community has benefitted from it.",

    "comment_text": "Personally for the cost, I would rather a 50w and lightburn, sure you will need a chiller and a bigger extractor, but the inability to be able to use a rotary, or a decent thickness of wood and the low power, the hard to clean, the fact you cant repair anything on it your self... Give me a machine I can work on my self every day of the week. \n\nalso closed ecosysytem for software nope sorry thats where pain comes, give it a few years and when glowforge decide they don't want to support it any more tough! (See Cricut for example of this happening) \n\nHaving a sealed path is a terrible idea in my view, replacing mirrors will be needed in the future and I bet that's a return to glow forge for them to do it and if its not then it will be an expensive option .\n\nA few questions, \n1) How long is the laser tube? cos it doesnt look like a real 40W have they done the trick of saying its peak and using that as a selling point, it looks (to me at least) more like a 35w tube. \n2) What's the fluid used for the cooling? does it have a decent amount of fluid in it? considering the size of most chillers they are bigger than the whole machine so what is it using? \n3) What's the max cutting and engraving speed? \n4) How easy to replace the lens? and how expensive? \n\n\nMy personal opinion is they are over priced and they also could do with someone understanding lasers doing the marketing (its not a printer for example) and to be honest they have a really bad reputation for going wrong due to things like ribbon cables, I guess they are the apple of the laser world, more expensive than a better option and a closed ecosystem .... \n\nNot for me but others might enjoy it.",

    "comment_text": "The fiber laser is unique in that the fibet itself is whar creates the laser light  or more specificly the excited ions doped within the lattice of the crystal or glass fiber. Most of the time or at least for consumer focused fiber lasers they are pumped with a powerful    bank  of LEDs which is the excitation source stimulating the emission of radiation. These types of lasers can be significantly less expensive for maintenance as well as initial cost thanks to the more simple beam path. Obviously there are many other factors involved in the cost of the unit and  quality of the beam,  spectrum of the beam , how the beams pulse shape  and duration are controlled ,  or if it has a continuous wave stable  beam... sorry,  i love lasers haha",

Probably the single most important test and one most people are going to be wanting to know more than anything (even if it never crossed their mind)! So how about it, how about REALLY putting it to the test and let us know how long we can expect it to survive before it burns out? The biggest issue with these diode lasers is they are weak and have such dismal life expectancies if that was known before the purchase people would not waste their money and it bothers me that someone like you that works with all types of lasers all the time, at least thats what you claim, one would think you are aware of this major issue! Yet its the one thing you make ZERO mention of and I just have to ask, is that because you already know it sucks?",

Just recently, the machine that has the rotary attachment started engraving the tumblers very badly. Like I tried everything to fix it, I put max resolution, lowered the speed all the way to 10, tried double engraving (it didn't work, the tumbler slips the second pass), I tried using the magic eraser to clean the leftover residue, and none of them worked. Does anyone know what to do in that situation? I am a seller on Amazon and Etsy and this problem is killing me.",

You have to understand what Lasers can do and do not do. I hope I can purchase something again soon now that even a 100-watt cutter and engraver are less than 25K!   Our Laser Shop also did acrylic we had a local shop that had at the time a 600-watt flatbed Mitsubishi and it would cut 1/2 inch acrylic like butter! Miss those days!",

I have a Cricut Maker cutting machine and it doesn't cut precisely and small enough which is why I'm looking for a laser cutter instead. The most common materials I would cut would be around 2mm or less, matboard to thin wood.\n\nI'm 33 but I find technology to be a little annoying. It's not my favorite thing to figure out software and do upgrades. I don't think I'm even capable. So I need something user friendly that I can use with SVG files.",

Because of the COVID virus we have now lost the only place I would have gone to look at and ask questions about it.  That is FRY's Electronics.  I was going to build a newer computer with newer components.  I like to buy locally and now there is no second choice place to go.  The whole printing and engraving environment is changing so fast I have been deliberately slow to get involved and jump in.  Would you be able to make suggestions on where to focus if I mentioned some of the criteria involved?  1)  Engrave small objects like in the size of Keys, Knife handles and up to the size of 6 inches square for just a little more versatility;  2)  Because of size - price should be small due to the versatility and usefulness is reduced (comparatively);  3)  Precision - due to the size of the engravings they will be examined closely.  4)  Engrave or etch but NOT cut through.  5) Small because of my needs and can't have it take up a lot of room.   6)  Engrave any metals that will dis-color noticeably. \n\nAll these are valid reasons that must be evaluated together.     If you can please give me a few suggestions.  Because I don't know what the prices may be, please consider price to be of the lesser requirement.  I want a good one that will do the job.

I want it to be able to do walnut, but everything always just says wood, and there are so many species of wood of different hardness, i cannot for the life of me find a simple yes. In your opinion, 3w diode able to surface engrave (maybe 1/8\") walnut, and other hardwoods.",

I think it goes for $1500 (I bought the kickstarter so its obviously a diff price) and I recommend it when ease of use and safety is accounted for. Research your seller to make sure good customer service is available. I haven't had problems and I've used it for about 8 months regularly. I also never cut at 50% to help save my CO2 laser, but thats a personal pref. Never look directly at lasers, always get glasses but you still shouldn't look directly at it with glasses on either.  Also research what materials you are cutting because gases released can be harmful if youre ignorant of what you're cutting. Hope this helps and glhf :)",

Couple things is this is my VERY first project in fusion 360, so it took me a long time to get everything dialed following your steps. I appreciate the thorough-ness of everything. Few daunting parts about \"you'll have to get all this dialed yourself\" when I know nothing about the program is a little intimidating, but I just followed your lead and am about to go try and cut this thing. Also side note, I took a screen shot of fusion 360, threw it in illustrator and just did a trace draw and deleted the paths inside, and it did seem to go a little quicker (Even though I lost my scale tool bar and couldn't figure out how to bring it back up) but also was way more precise on the edges (or so it seems, will let you know after the cut).

I have a 20 watt diode laser cutter/engraver and it cant cut worth a shit unless i do 20 passes at 100% power. So i only use it for engraving.. Not why i bought it.\n\nDo you know of a 110v model?

    "comment_text": "Why are galvo lasers not used on a gantry?  it seems like galvo = small work area but fast travel, gantry = slow but big work area. why not do a galvo head on a gantry to get a large work area and a wider (not directly downward) beam on a gantry?  If the galvo head is coupled to a wire source (or other pump configuration), the galvo head should be easily movable relative to the diode bank (my understanding is that fiber optic fibers/wires/cables are flexible and durable).  if the gantry could move the galvo head over a large area, that might also mitigate the other con of galvo heads you mentioned (sub optimal angles at limits of galvo head), because the galvo head wouldn’t need to be pushed to reach as far to yield a work area that seems competitive (it could stay within an optimal angular range relative to the travel of and on the gantry).  I’m not currently working in the laser industry so I apologize if this a dumb question.",

We had the new machine for 2 months. Nothing but problems with it. It wouldn't cut on normal settings. It also would start randomly not cutting or excessively burning on higher settings. Finally glowforge sent a \"referbished\" replacement for our brand new 5000$ machine. The refer machine showed up with cooling liguid leaked all over. Tried running the machine at glowforge support request & the entire laser arm is off center running crooked & is completely noisy because the track wheels are worn.\nI highly recommend no one buy a glowforge. Their customer service sucks & there is zero product support. Their poor business model is a devistating model for your business if you are trying to run 9ne with glowforge.",

    "comment_text": "I got a glowforge basic back when they were $2k.  I love it, and use it semi-regularly as a hobbyist.  I will say that since seeing them introduce the subscription service and push it so hard, I've had the constant sneaking worry that one day they'll try and lock all function of my glowforge behind a paywall, but so far they haven't done that.  I only ever upload designs so I have no need for the subscription.  If they ever do decide to brick it for a subscription (or go under and their webclient ceases to be), I'll look at other companies, but I can't afford to upgrade as long as I've got a working laser already.\n\nDespite my overall very positive experience with glowforge, I don't think I'd recommend them to someone now, when you can get a more powerful laser that can run in house software for less money.  When it was 2k, it was also one of the only really user friendly lasers on the market, and one of the cheapest lasers.  At twice the price, and still locked into glowforge's online software, I just don't see why anyone would pick it over a competitor.",

In fact, they didn't even read my email, which asked about being able to buy the on/off pushbutton switch that is sticking, and their response was to ignore me.  I asked to pay for a service call.  At this point I have actually convinced two people to buy a competitors model and I am working on my third person.  I purchased the laser and requested support from the Anaheim California location, but I have not seen anything to let me know that the entire company is not represented by the same lousy service.  I would be fine with their lack of help, but even when I asked if there was anyone who could help, I was met with silence.  I was finally able to find someone who does service for Laser in LA, and I was happy to pay for the help.  I am very disgusted with Omtech's complete lack of service.  If you are going to buy a laser, try to find someone who has and uses one.  Service / Customer Service / repair is very hard to find.",

It would not even detect the dot pattern unless I opened the lid part way.  It seemed like Lightburn doesn't like the 180 pano camera lens, but this is my first machine with a camera.   I'll fiddle more tomorrow.",

Like every single person on the planet knew of and used photoshop at least a few times in their lives.\nThen they did the cloud thing.. and guess what.. NO ONE uses photoshop anymore except their super rich nich businesses that already havent moved on to other technology.\n\nThats the vibe I get. Autodesk was something of a community of free users improving their help and tutorials and user interface. Everyone knew what autodesk was even if you never used its software. \nThey will go 100% cloud and be premium for a insane priceing stradegy only to attract the richest of the rich customers all while making their name on the free version no longer offered.\n\nFU Autodesk\n\nMoving on to something else before i get used to your software then you take it away and charge $2600 a year.",

I had a couple initial hiccups running it with my Mac (no usb and I needed a usb to usb c conversion and then still my Mac not recognizing it for whatever reasons and next trying to run it through a gfci outlet was a no go and still trying to figure out Wi-Fi/Ethernet connection stuff). But now running lightburn on my daughter’s pc it is working great. Much more powerful /fast/capable than my glowforge plus and wow for the price. If you follow the unboxing and setup videos that are on YouTube, read the manual thoroughly, then it doesn’t take long to understand it and get running. TBD if I can get my Mac to recognize it. Also 7mm hold down pins was my first cut and that appears to be the sweet spot",

    "comment_text": "Glowforge is a compete pos. Prior to buying my 50w Omtech, I rented a Glowforge from a friend, and it was 100% unusable because you HAVE TO scan the bed with the camera prior to every burn. So, if you think you’re going to design something and pound a bunch of them out, 1 after the other, you’re going to be seriously disappointed. It makes no difference that every piece is on exactly the same material and there is no need to scan every time. You HAVE TO. Their software is crap and replacement parts are more trouble than their worth.\n\nI had a Lightburn camera on my Omtech. I took it out and threw it away. I can’t imagine what could possibly be the use for something so wildly inaccurate, and that’s after having spent far too much time mastering the calibration procedure. I’d disagree with the statement that Omtech support is great. It’s not. I had an issue with a loose X axis belt. I spent several days going back and forth with them and their suggestions for what to do had nothing - literally zero - to do with the problem, which was a loose belt. I figured it out on my own. Aside from that, I’ve been VERY happy with the machine and I’m coming up on a year of using it for production manufacturing.",

Especially if they can give you their store logo art work to put on the top. It's kind of branding the bar so to speak. That is my secret business lol, wasn't trying to advertise it but its ok, it's not original,  just business",

One guy on youtube publishes a design build, and viewers complain when he doesn't make dimensions or code available.  When a creator does publish build files, code, etc., you can subsequently find that design being sold online as some douche's original work.\n\nSome people are actual creators.

    "comment_text": "1:25 and even if you don't have a table saw you can just plane it by hand. No need to buy all kinds of powertools.\n1:55 dowels are optional. They can help against slippage while gluing, maybe even make the joints marginally stronger, but you don't actually need them.\n2:20 this is actually nonsense. If you alternate the directions you're going to get a wavy surface. You're averaging out the warping, but not stopping the warping. If you keep them all in one direction and make sure it wants to bow in an upward arch, if you then fasten the middle securely the entire rail the top rests on will stop it from warping altogether (that is, unless there's so much force the fastening doesn't hold, but you shouldn't get such moisture extremes indoors).\n40:20 you did the breadboard wrong. In the board itself you can just drill holes, but the part it slides over can only have a normal drill hole in the middle (to keep the breadboard centered). The other holes need to be elongated slots rather than just holes, so the pins going through them have room to move sideways (but not length wise obviously). Just a few millimeters, but what you've done now is basically the same as screwing the board on. This creates stress. Also, there's no need to glue it in the middle. You can, but you should glue less wide than you did. Just a bit around the centre pin.\n 4:20 yup, you need to practice planing. Especially sharpening your plane. Make it sharp, slightly round the corners, use a shallow setting, work methodically, and you won't have marks. Also, you need to check whether the sole of your plane is flat. \n\nGood on you for keeping practicing and wanting to learn!",

I know you mentioned upgrading the diodes so I'm assuming that's a DYI  project and if your diode is 'dead' you can order a replacement. How about replacing the CO2 tube? Are there any other parts that may wear out? Thanks.",

But once you find the height, measure it with calipers.  Then make a block that height--in my case, I 3D printed a simple rectangular block, was able to get within 0.05mm of the desired height, I think.  Then, if you want to etch, place your block on top of the etching surface, and let the laser module rest on the block while tightening.  If you want to burn, set your block on the empty honeycomb (or whatever sacrificial surface), and let the module rest on the block while tightening--remove the block and insert your material to burn.  This puts the focal length at the bottom of the material.  Note, this only works for up to a few millimeters of material.",

One thing I would have loved to have heard from you is what the main differences between a diode-based machine and a co2-based machine. I know you touched on diodes are more “beginner/budget”, and more compact and portable, but what are the pros and cons of each? Who’s the audience for each platform? And why would a diode be a better fit for this type of person, be a co2? And visa versa? I get that typically a co2 machine has a bigger work area, but I can’t image that’s the only benefit of going the co2-based route. Thoughts?",

If the mill is chocking up use an end mill with more flutes or a higher rotation speed. Also you need mills with cutting geometry specifically for soft metals like aluminium and brass on low powered machines like this. If you had tried this with brass it would have probably given even worse results because brass is so soft it tends to grab the cutter so definitely needs correct end mills with the correct geometry. Also a shorter end mill will help and repositioning the spindle higher up in the mount will produce less stresses in the z axis and gantry assemblies.",

The unit clearly states it has an Autofocus Laser head separate from the camera. You could not use the rotary engraver without an autofocus head due to the irregularity of what you are engraving. Am I missing something?\n\nThanks",

    "comment_text": "I bought this 3020 in Nov 2021 strictly for aluminum cutting. I’ve been using a competitors machine for over a decade and it works great. I was disappointed with this machine and had several issues. It will cut aluminum but not not very well. The 1/8” bit must be all the way in the shaft. (And to prevent milling the table it’s best to lower the Z axis to the lowest point and raise the spindle in the holder so the bit can’t reach the table.) But the spindle is just not rigid enough to handle the cutting, the length of the shaft allows slight flexing. And the spindle doesn’t have enough speed or torque. I found that even slowly cutting a 1” hole in 2mm aluminum with 9 passes was nail biting. It did cut the hole but was a struggle. The finished hole was a few thousands under size because the spindle rigidity was causing it to flex inward. And just drilling a 1/8” hole w the milling bit would sputter when reaching the bottom, and wallowed the hole almost every time. So to fix both issues I hack sawed the spindle holder (another problem-only a 55mm spindle fits), and mounted a $70 rotozip (600W 30K RPM) with metal strapping. Now it mills, drills, and cuts much better. Note that after less than 10 hours the 300W spindle stopped working.\n\nThe other issue I had was that most all of the USB software I tried wouldn’t run a few commands of my existing gcode. Also, it was essential that I could stop and start the gcode from any gcode line, and couldn’t do it! So, to get around those problems I abandoned the USB controller and bought a parallel stepper driver and use LinuxCNC (or Mach2).\n\nOverall it’s a nice little machine but wouldn’t recommend for aluminum unless your into mods.",

First, the performance seemed to be slightly better when engraving and second but more importantly were the customer service oriented ratings. There seemed to be a trend towards a lack of customer service with xTool lately. I know there is a lot of turmoil going on in China right now so this is probably a temporary thing. Lastly, Amazon had a flash sale on the LM3 the other day making it $595 so I jumped on it. That left more money for accessories which we'll need to run these at there best. Just my 2 cents... \n\nCheers,\nGreg",

    "comment_text": "Engraving DPI is hugely important.  While I know 1200 DPI on a diode or fiber is doable, they are mainly marking machines (not cutting).  When I compared machines, I asked specifically about DPI ... they all report higher numbers than to be expected AND/or skipped around an answer ... their website numbers cannot be trusted.  The newer gen. machines have better motors than the 4+ yr old designs and can consistently do +800dpi, like the 2 co2 machines you mentioned.  There are more economy options that can perform, and there are more DIY coolers that aren't messy nor expensive.  I have a BOSS 70W and can cut/engrave basically anything I desire.  but it's older and doesn't have the newer motors (so the effective DPI is about 1/2 of the newer machines with the smallest focal lens), but it can be upgraded.  If it's a hobby, speed isn't as important ... precision is.  i would never spend less than $3k on any laser, period.  People ask when i give them stuff i make: \" You did what?\"  i say:\"yes, I'm a Jedi, I cut stuff with light\".  Diodes imo don't count.  I've used over 36 types of materials .. and my co2 hasn't failed me yet.",

    "comment_text": "If you're spending 4-7 grand on a machine, the learning curve is insignificant.  Once you've learnt it, you don't keep learning it.  What does matter, is the day to day experience of using it once you've climbed that curve.  For example. I have a great bean-to-cup coffee machine.  It makes great coffee, and I can tweak it to my heart's content, even though it's a clunky interface.  What is unforgiveable, is that every single time I turn it on, I have to wait for it to go through a cleaning cycle.  I can't put my cup under the brew head until it's finished, or it will fill with dirty water, so I can't just press a button and let it do its stuff.  Before it turns off, it cleans itself again.  It cleans itself so often, I have to refill the water really often, and empty the drip tray just as often.  I have another, much less fancy, less refined machine that I bought when the other broke down.  I can press the power button, and twenty seconds later press the button to brew the coffee, and a minute later I'm drinking espresso.  It's not quite as good at making my perfect coffee, but it's pretty good, it's harder to dial it in, it's noisier, and nothing like as polished, but in daily use it's so much more user friendly that I prefer it to my other machine.\nFor laser cutters, if you have to spend a couple of minutes getting the focus just right, or you need several trial runs to set the power/speed for each job, it doesn't matter how easy to learn it is, it's going to get tiresome pretty quickly.  Another machine might be hard to learn at first, you might need to build up a database of materials and power/speeds, but if, after doing that, all you have to do is insert the stock and press start, and know that it'll do the same good job every time, that machine will win every time.",

    "comment_text": "Nice content, but I absolutely hate the way you blend advertising for your sponsor with editorial.  It's just not the done thing.  Imagine if you were watching the news, and an article ran \"City news, and share prices took a tumble today, closing 400 points down on the day, and that's why we recommend you invest with XYZ Corp\".  Would you respect their coverage?  I doubt it.  You wouldn't know whether the news was accurate, or was fabricated or exaggerated as a set up for the advertising.  If you blur the lines between editorial and advertising, how are we to know whether one of the models you mention was a paid promotion?  I'm not suggesting that's what you're doing, but I don't know you.  If you're prepared to sneak advertising into your editorial, how can I know whether you're up to other tricks?  I can't.",

    "comment_text": "This long comment is in no way criticising  this video. It is ,hopefully, adding more techincal colour to this already informative video.\n\n Any 50 watt tube will be 1000mmm long and 50mm diameter. 50 watts is the max power test spec. NOT what you can use. This will be an 800mm long 40 watt tube  that will fit iinsde the 970mm wide case. 50 watts is marketeing speak. There are major issues with fume extraction and Gweike have issued a couple of upgrades (check out their videos). You need air FLOW through the  machine to extract fumes. You cannot get FLOW through a closed box like the Glowforge and the little grill on the Gweike is an inadequate  concession to this requirement of physics. \n600mm/s is a meaningless marketing spec if you dont have the power to damnage material at that speed . Every different type of wood or material has a different damage threshold so the MDF used in this test  requires a critical level light  INTENSITY for a certain EXPOSURE time to damage it. The fixed INTENSITY of a candle flame will damage your hand if you pass it through the flame slow enough.......that demonstates what exposure time means... That is the whole  principle of engraving. The Gweike  has a typical 2\" lens but you can make the candle beam more intense  because Gweike supply a shorter 1.5\" lens. and that means faster engraving .....but poorer cutting. Not an option on the Glowforge. \n\n The overtavel at the end of each scan depende on the speed you choose to scan at. If you decide to run at 300mm/s (as per the video)  then the overtravel  is a fixed non-engraving event.  In this case the Gweike  is running at 250dpi so there are also 250 scans  per inch of image that is 500 non-engraving events per inch. The Glowforge has 450 non engraving events per inch. So there is MORE wasted time on the Gweike but it still engraves quicker becuse of its shorter overtravel (faster acceleration.)  Because the Gweike machine can run with the native Ruida software (RDWorks) or Lightburn. you have the opportunity to crank up the acceleration (software controlled) and make the Gweike run light years faster than the  \"you cant touch anything\" Glowforge.\n\nSpeed is meaningless for cutting, it always has to be done slowly, maybe 10 to 20mm/s would be typical  depending on material and thickness.. Neither machine is setup with  a cutting  configuration where the nozzle would  be close to the work. Thus any air assist is only protecting the lens and not making cutting more efficient. These are essentially engraving machines that can cut inefficiently.  Look at all the brown fume depositions around the cuts., that means  air  assist will do a great job of painting your engravings with this tarry residue.   \n\nCutting should always be done with a single pass, which CO2 lasers can do easily because they operae on a totally different wavelength to diode laserswhich for many physics reasons are very inefficient at cutting and require multiple passes.\n\n Auto focus is a big problem. A lens will be sold with a fixed focal length. But that focal length does NOT apply to lasers.That lens will work as specified if you put it into a telescope or camera where you are focusing an IMAGE with normal random non-coherent light. A laser beam si totally different and there is no IMAGING involved .  the aim is to focus light INTENSITY. If you focus a lens to cut efficiently at 10mm/s  it is certain that the best focal distance will be at least 1mm different to the manufacturer's fixed focus. Now try engraving at 400mm/s and the best focus (thinnest line) will be 2 or 3mm different.. The best focus also depends on the material being used. So power, speed and material can all affect the optimal INTENSITY focal point. So how can auto focus take all these factors into account? Thus the less sophisticated motor driven (software controlled) focus of the Gweike allows you to take thes various parameters into account  and lets YOU select the best focus  when you understand a bit more about the peculiarities of laser technology.\n\n$50/month to ACCESS a machine that you may have already paid $5000 for  seems  scam that no one would ever fall for.   Hmmmm.  Ease of use?. I can remember when I was 5,  I probably had little or no technical ability. This machine would have been a great techno toy where I could make things happen with little or no knowledge of the technology. As a 5 year old it would have still required my dad to set it up before I could \"play\" with it.. This is a well presented video  but he and I  cant unlearn knowledge,  so making a  \"an ease of use\" judgment is very difficult. Where is the baseline?\n\nAs a business machine for making money the Gwieke wins hands down. Its faster (and, with knowledge, can be made even faster),  greater flexibility, much lower price. no forced rental of software and  no need for an internet connection. It also allows you to make mistakes and learn about laser technology in the process, so that  you are prepared for your jump up to a bigger more powerful machine.  Glowforge is a closed box where you have purposely been excluded from learning about laser technology. Its a great business model .\n\n\nFinal technical note. 100%power ?  The tube %power is not really watts. This is glass tube technology and the tube manufacturer specifies the safe  MAXIMUM current allowed to flow through the tube. The tube watts is determined by the current flow. For a 40 watt tube  the max RUNNING current you can use will be 18mA for a 40 watt tube and  19mA for a 45 watt tube (Do I believe Glowforge is 45 watts?  Note the tube dimensions and check on any tube manufacturers website). It is possible to set the high voltage power supply so that 100%power  does not exceed  these limits. This  protects the tube and give it 4 years or more life. I belive the Gweike has an ammeter fitted that allows you to check this.  Glowforge?  I think not.   Exceeding these limits through lack of knowledge  could be expensive and ruin your tube within a year. The mA current flow and watts output are not related linearly   so for example  for your 18mA  max current you will get 40 watts output  but at 1/3 of the current flow (6ma) you will be expecting 33%power ie13 watts.  Sadly no,  because the relationship is non-linear you will probably be delivering 20 or evern 25 watts. The % power applies to current flow through your tube and NOT watts.   50% power is not 20 watts.",

No reason why it couldn’t be controlled locally with the same features.  Autofocus has never worked for me.  The camera is at best 1/2” off making it basically useless.  It can’t even manage to scan its own QR codes.",

My concern is more based on a recent comment (mom23sweetpeas). These manufacturers really need to get their act together with customer service. It's a deal-breaker at this price level IMO. We're not all mechanically or technically minded. I don't think I'd have had the resilience to have endured all of that, and at the end they had to send back at great inconvenience.\n\nStill it's a shame; the g-machine looks fabulous and would have otherwise been my choice between the two.",

Basically they are just trying to copy the Glowforge with no real innovation, but at a reduced cost.\nReally hoping for the next iteration of tech before I have to choose. \nAlso, the subscription software has a lot of add-ins now like patterns, shapes, and borders. it also stores all your prints, so you can reprint something really quick.",

As an owner of a glowforger for over 2 years I have learned a lot and definitely have things I like and don't like that I hope are changed/kept with future glowforge models and wouldn't mind also seeing how other machines do these things better or worse.

Typical CO2 machines will have a dot size of .1mm to .15mm diameter compared to the dot size of .08mm x .1mm on the diode machines. A smaller dot size means the power is concentrated more. You will NOT be cutting 10mm plywood in a single pass on a 50W CO2 machine (I have one). Also, engravings will not be as crisp, although the larger CO2 machines offer faster engraving output from better rails and more powerful stepper motors.",

I use LightBurn on the Xm-1060.   I make artistic wood boxes, so this worked well for that.   K40 did etch glass, stone, cut leather and wood, and engraved fairly decently...  The only upgrades I did was a better exhaust, diamond grill bed and a new Lens ..  My son owns a Glowforge.  He doesn't use it 3% of what I use my Xm-1060 or even the K40!  I think the K40 with the dsp, exhaust, mirror, lense and new controller ( with Lightburn ) is all you need for more than casual use of the K40.",

    "comment_text": "Glowforge was my introduction into the laser world (purchased through their original Kickstarter campaign in 2016), and 7 laser purchases later, I still use three Glowforge's daily.  Luckily 90% of our products are flat acrylic, smaller pieces that the Glowforge can handle easily so as far as ease of use goes, we just keep at least two of them cranking out products daily.  We do love Lightburn when it comes to the larger 150W CO2 we use for our big stuff, rotary, etc. as well as our new Fiber laser (thank god for Lightburn Galvo) so we can see how both situations bring value to your business.  Being an early Glowforge adopter, we paid half the price for both of our Basics and our Pro, so I'm not sure if I would choose Glowforge now at their current price point, but I really do love the cameras, auto-focus, and small footprint.  And their customer service has been other-worldly as well (several replacements (not necessarily their fault), overnight parts delivery, you name it).",

    "comment_text": "By not including much about the pass through you are missing most of what makes the Glowforge pro better. Otherwise your G-machine is far more comparable to the Glowforge machines in the same price bracket. Instead of he 14 inch height of the G-machine the Pro can use material as big as you can fit in the house, not only for large projects but I buy my material 48\" long and use as much as I need  Yes the 40 watt machines are rated at less power, but Glowforge does not \"overclock\"their machines so they last longer than if they run at max power. As for premium, if someone is trying to make money right away premium  opens up thousands of free designs that they can legally sell right away so if you have a market. If you want to design in Inkscape you have less of an incentive, but I still find many conveniences that I  use instead of going back to Inkscape or Gimp and reloading. With the many free designs ( full disclosure a few of mine as well) there is also access to the entire Noun Project that does not allow commercial use of their designs, but Glowforge worked out a deal and they get some of that premium fee also. So if you do not want to learn Inkscape, Gimp or many of the more pricey options. The Glowforge app is av pretty good design tool that you can even use on your tablet or phone. \n\nOn another point, once the cur is loaded on to the machine there is no internet needed, so if the internet goes out while it is cutting it will not affect the machine. Unfortunately you cannot keep running that file again, though many have suggested it. Which brings up another point. There is a great deal of hands on connection that takes place over time. There are many complaints that connecting to support is more time consuming  than they like, but the volume is huge and it may take a bit, but the final result is far better than my abilities to interact with any other company.",

I did a ton of research and ended up buying a Thunder Laser USA.... Nova 35-100watt. It came in at almost the same price and the difference in these two machines are immeasurable. The Thunder Laser came with over double the power. The ability to cut/engrave 24\"x36\" and had pass through. Not to mention it has over 7\" of z height with the ability to use a rotary. I honestly can't believe people pay so much for a GlowForge. Do your research and you can either save a lot of money or get a industrial quality laser for the same price. \nhttps://youtu.be/bqObk0NKbTc",

Did not get the GF due to 1. closed system in both software and hardware and 2. price. If anyone is looking for other users of the GC, their facebook group(s) is your best place. They have like 3 facebook groups and it is confusing but join them all. You will find me and many others on there who love the GC.\n\ncomments to the video:\n-gweikeclouds hinges are horrible unless you open it all the way (not sure how the GF is). better if the hinges hold at any angle. \n-passthrough is easy. just stick a magnet or something metal where the sensor is. but unfortunately fumes will escape.\n-air compressor indeed is external on the GC but that means you can swap it to whatever you want. on GF its not upgradeable.\n\nAnd yes, a big con is gweikes marketing. case and point you mention \"autofocus.\" something is lost in translation there. They also make this mistake marketing the air assist. Heck a big con is indeed this overseas translation thing. While tech support is VERY responsive (you get assigned to like 7 tech people through an app after the purchase of the machine) sometimes small details can be lost in translation. Is that worth paying the thousands for a GF over the GC? nah. its not THAT bad but just a heads up from me to whoever looking to buy a GC.\n\nAlso i should mention for cost of the GC, it CAN get even cheaper as Gweike runs events here and there where you can get cash that brings down your initial purchase cost.",

    "comment_text": "This was a very helpful video!  I would love to ask you what is the machine that you would get, similar travels on the axes with more on the z if possible, that can mill aluminum without serious compromise.  \n\nSince aluminum likes to mess with us with it being gummy let's machine the gummiest aluminum - is that 6061 - if not please just specify and let's make say a motor mount plate.  So a square shape, say 3\"x3\" by 3/8 or 1/2\" when finished with a bunch of holes punched through for through bolts, some holes to be tapped, \n\nLets also mill a pattern into the face of this square of aluminum that is say a 2\" square shape that is 1/4\" wide square track that we are ending with. The feature is also a finished depth of 1/4\".  \n\nSo if we are using proper feeds and speeds from the machinists handbook or other proper sources what is the most depth we can take on each pass say even on your typical industrial heavy duty vertical milling machine.  That sets our target or best possible case, then can you answer in your opinion which brand machine in these low dollar tiers do you think can actually come close to this level of performance.\n\nLast but not least this machine needs to be capable of true 3d milling into aluminum. Lets say we are going to mill a ball shape where we have a semi-circle full round shape the diameter of the circle is 3\" and the height at the center of the shape is also 3\" - so we are getting what would look like a bandsaw slice through part of a pool ball cut in half,   Which machine can get great surface finishes and also do the work in a reasonable amount of time.  I am assuming that if a machine could make this 3d feature then it could likely make most features that i would ever need it to.  Please let me know if this is a poor assumption.\n\n\nThis whole CNC market has so many machines that could never hope to do this work which is fairly basic work for sure.  And I know that this was a little bit to read but I am hoping those of you with knowledge and experience will simply be able to just snap your fingers and say - yea, get a \"THIS BRAND\" and get \"MODEL ABC123\", they are great!  \n\nOh damn, we can't forget about cost, I would ask 2 things for cost.  1 - can you do this for under $1000?  How about for under $800 and wow if we can you can do this for $500.  \n\nI have no idea what to expect so I hope that there is some feedback and all of it is going to be greatly appreciated.

    "comment_text": "Sorry but I find it quite annoying that people keep referring to these lasers as “Chinese” Lasers. I’m sure you already know that most everything you use, from clothing to computer are made in China, or has a part that’s made there. Who F-ing cares if it’s from China or made in someone’s back yard in Tijuana, so long as it’s good quality and works.  The “made in china” slur Is not relevant in todays culture. When the US consumer market becomes predominantly made in the USA, then saying “made in china” might have some relevance.",

If the work area on the lc-40 was the same as Xtool d1 or larger & it had a 10 or 20w laser option, it would be the far superior machine. For ENGRAVING, genmitsu jensoku lc-40 is superior. I want to cut thin wood & use rotary, though. So I was forced to by d1 pro 10w since 20w is way too expensive right now. Speed trade off, right? If lc-40 had 10 or 20w, I definitely would have bought that. If I was ONLY engraving, it would be the best laser for that, hands down. Build is just that much better. Linear rails, no brainer.",

Also planned on using lightburn so software wasn't an issue for me, although I do like xtools platform better.",

This needs to be addressed early in the video!\n\nAdditionally, you may not have been paid for this review, but you were provided the machine for free and your links in the description are clearly affiliate links to the product in question.

I can cut out pattern pieces of full grain leather with the knife without burning any edges, then laser engrave, all in one go. Originally, the 45-degree blades that came with the box were not able to cut through my 1.2mm veg tan, but I saw that after product launch, they released a 60-degree blade. Shipping was going to make those blades extremely expensive, so I took a risk, ran to Hobby Lobby, and bought Cricut Deep Cut blades to see if they work. They do!! Pretty sure they're the exact same blade as what xTool is selling. I would love if the Cricut knife blade would also work with the M1, but it seems more proprietary. Maybe xTool will make one. \n\nTake care!!",

Also what do you think the life of this machine is with daily use?  I'm just starting out with laser engraving. That said I don't want to buy something I would need to replace very soon. Money is definitely a factor for me. It looks like laser engraving would definitely enhance my wood working projects. Just not sure what machine to start with. Right now I'm watching videos on different machines which can be confusing to say the least. I'm also taking this time to watch videos on lightsribe, it looks like a very good program for what my needs will be. Thanks in advance.",

Predominately I make boxes so the laser and cnc functions are what I use most of the time. If you were working on bigger items like furniture then I'd definitely steer clear.

    "comment_text": "Since MOPA is better for plastics, I'm curious how well a small, simple machine like this would do with PCB prototyping or small scale manufacturing. It wouldn't be too difficult to have a multi-material profile, just switch frequency and amplitude within a certain set of lines in the code. 'Etching' a PCB would be such a great alternative to the typical developing methods, as even some of the newer prototyping methods, like using a photoresist PCB blank on the LCD of an MSLA printer, still require developing in chemicals. If this could not only etch the traces, but also etch the board for proper marking, I don't see why this couldn't be a viable alternative to cheap board manufacturing. Stemming from this, I'm curious how well this kind of laser handles various solder masks, say if someone wanted to mask a whole board then etch the masking off the pads, instead of more typical processes; most PCB software already separate pads and traces, so technically you'd already have a file for just pads, with the proper settings you could potentially etch the solder mask but not the copper pad underneath. \n\nIf it works out, something like this could be great for maker spaces, assuming someone had already gone through the calibrations for specific materials, thicknesses, etc. Even as a hobbyist or small business, a machine like this would be amazing for prototyping and small production runs.",

No clarity on where they ship from. As an EU citizen, I have the right to know. \n\nAs per EU Standard, the seller needs to tell the customer where its dispatched when placing an order, VAT, etc. If I ask about VAT, the Xtool customer support personnel is giving an inclusive response.  What I understood is partly they want to ship from the EU & partly from outside the EU. \n\nThere is a tax obligation, depending on where they fulfill from. This needs to be clear when placing the order, if they ship from the EU, they pay VAT in one of the EU countries where you ship from. Otherwise, it's an export order, either they pay if you have IOSS registration or I need to pay on import extra cost to me. \n\nYou are mixing up, and dogging after the initial response.  Maybe Xtool is good, but not possible to buy from with in EU.  After a week of chatting with them, now I am looking into some other brand.",

I would like to make a whole bunch of wood puzzles and I do NOT want there to be any angles of any sort on the pieces. I want the pieces to be truely Square to the surface. So since the laser is NOT MOVED directly above I would guess that the laser is always cutting at some varying angle to the surface of material being cut which for my uses makes it a worthless device for me to have.

To solve the issue with all the extra hose as you pointed out I was able to add a small shelf above the D1 and added a loose fitting wire tie around it and the wire harness so they travel together , no issues so far. Time for a clink and install table . as always thanks for all your videos and help ! Keep up the informative and entertaining stuff ! Cheers !!       John in Florida    A.K.A.  Fla Dude  🙂✌",

I'm very surprised you picked Glowforge above all other desktop lasers. \n\nHaving used both the Glowforge and others, the only benefit to Glowforge is ease of getting started.  The native Glowforge software is a bit easier to use, but it is also feature poor. They also hobble the software unless you pay a monthly subscription fee. \n\nOther drawbacks include - cleaning the Glowforge is more difficult, and the laser is underpowered for the price. Most importantly, and most hidden from the customer, - their support is weak at best; they are slow to respond to issues, if they ever do; and they don't really sell key replacement parts for wear and tear, instead they want you to ship your machine back and purchase a refurbished device for all but the smallest issues. \n\nOh, and  you have to upload your designs to their cloud based service, meaning you can't print if your internet is offline and they can monitor what you print on your machine.",

I would just be starting out would you suggest a diode or CO2? Specifically one of these two machines. I guess the main thing that these would be used for is designs on leather and tumblers/cups. Any advice would be Appreciated. Thanks advance.",

It appears that at the moment the 2S has been replaced by the 3Max but has the same laser equipment, or am I wrong?  Also, just an idea on review: in the RC community there are a lot of people that build their own aircraft from scratch (Balsa and plywood 3mm) and need to cut the wood with precision.  Which machine would you recommend or such a job?  knowing that the CO2 lasers are deemed a bit too expensive and too small for that use.  My idea was to look at the Neje 3 max as it has a nice big surface to work with but the question remains about how much power do you really need? is it the 5,5 or 6, 10 or even the 12W version.  If possible I would like to get you take on this?  Again thanks for all your reviews!!",

From what I’ve seen it’s a good machine.  I also love the modular design, and sealed parts with rugged cables.\n\nMy main complaint is that it’s not open source, granted they have fears of copycats i guess?  Maybe they could do something like open source the last generation each time they make a new one?\n\nI’m excited to see the one in it’s printing, because a locked down extruder/nozzle ecosystem is a concern i have not knowing much about this.\n\nAlso selling “toolplates” so you could make a drag knife (or knife + servos for turning with the cut), or marker, or even EDM module would be really cool.  I think one channel has made their own pen  holder for the snapmaker.  Open Sourcing the standard could help toolhead development too.\n\nI guess in conclusion if they could open source it, and/or get the cost of the rotary+enclosure+machine down to maybe 1,000-1,500 USD or so it would be top tier of “first 3d printer” category, not just “best all in one machine”!  But as of now that all in one aspect is it’s only real plus i guess.",

Parts may fit in area of 12x12 in unless they are maybe in two sections.\n\nAs per your videos co2 cutter seems to be best option but i do not think i need a 40W power laser cutter but i do not know.\n\nThanks\n\nAlex \nGreetings from TX.",

    "comment_text": "\"15 watt\" laser? This is true. The laser manufacturers are taking the idea of running electronics at a lower power to lengthen their lives. GE used to do that with incandescent lifebulbs - they would manufacture the bulbs to run at 130v AC so that when we used them at normal household voltage (110-120) the bulbs would last a lot longer than typical bulbs. So NEJE is doing the same with their modules - building them with 15 watt, but driving them to produce 10.5 -11 watt output. So even if you run them at 100% for long projects, the laser will still continue to produce full power and have a decent lifespan. I have been reading how a few laser users are finding out that their lesser well-designed lasers would die soon after a project that required their lasers to run at 100% for an extended period of time. This is why NEJE, Atomstack and  other laser manufacturers are doing this \"underpowering\" their laser modules to extend their lives. They use 7.5 watt laser diodes and only force them to deliver 5 Watts. The dual diodes are 7.5 diodes x2, each powered to produce about 5.5 Watts each to result in a 10-12 watt laser, depending on the manufacturer. These NEW modules are typically rated with 20, 000 hour life spans.",

    "comment_text": "I’ve been using my T250 for about a month now. I’ve found it to be a way better printer than my Ender 3 V2, easy to set up, easy to calibrate and much more even bed heating. I’ve found it way easier to get consistent layering and I haven’t had a print come loose yet. Once you get the work flow down swapping between modes is about 5 minutes work. Laser works well for engraving and cuts 2mm birch,  it it’s slow. Luban works well very well if you’re just doing something straight forward. \n\nMy assessment, it’s much easier to get started, get making and get consistent results with this than my Ender. I enjoy using the snapmaker and feel like I get to focus on the project not the machine. My first month with the ender was an endless series of failed prints, great learning experience but at times quite discouraging. First time I booted up the SM, it auto calibrated, I dropped the print head 0.5mm, hit print and got a perfect print of a model I was still failing to get on the Ender after a half dozen attempts.\n\nFor the hardcore 3D printers out there perhaps the bang for the buck is low, for the rest of us this is great",

Is sturdy, elegant and just works, I use cura, ligthburn and fusion 360 because luban is very basic. I upgraded the power supply and linear modules and its really silent now. I also 3d printed accessories  for pen (for plotter art) and a drag knife for cutting vinyl. No complaints here. A lot of the issues I see people complaining are more about all the things you need to know not get a good 3d print like calibration or filament humidity, all things you have to learn to get good results.",

    "comment_text": "I have one. I hate it, and I truly wish I had bought a D1, cheap CNC, and upgraded a few of my enders. Would have saved me a lot of time and money. \n\nSo within a week of opening the machine, I reached out to Snapmaker for support concerning the laser function. Turns out the guy I got stuck with didn't know what he was talking about. He told me it was broken, and I was then jacked around for 3 months before they stopped replying at all. 3 months later (6 months in total) They reach back out to me concerning a negative review I left on a third party site.  I used their contact to start trying to get help from them again, only to find out the problem I originally had is a limitation of the machine itself. Camera capture cannot accurately capture tall items  (3-4\" tall) for engraving. It just cuts out massive sections of the image. So 6 months, countless hours of time, and countless materials wasted trying to fix a machine that they said was broken... that wasn't. \n\nThey also removed my negative review from their site, and tried to bribe me into taking down my third party site review. \n\nI did end up getting a 50% refund, but that was because I was prepared to dispute the charges with Paypal. It's an ok, non upgradeable 3D printer. It's not a Prusa, or even an Ender. Haven't had a chance to play with the CNC yet, as the machine is noisy enough on its own. \n\nMy review stands, and I'll continue to tell everyone about my experiences. The machine is meh, and the support is crap.",

In the Neje wiki documentation I've found that they recommend setting it at a focal distance of about 33mm for engraving and about 55mm for cutting (18mm ply?!?).  You have to unscrew the lens about 7 full rotations from it's fully 'closed' or seated position against the upper housing for engraving but it definitely produces a finer spot. \n\nMy USB microscope doesn't have a measurement tool but from my very rough estimate, it looks like I can get a line width of around .12 when setup for the 'engraving'  focal distance.\n\nI'm sure folks would appreciate your more seasoned look at it - especially as you call it out as having a bigger dot width, which may not be entirely accurate given the configuration options. \n\nI hope this observation comes across in the most positive light,  I really appreciate all videos and your calibration methods - super helpful for someone new to the technology! Keep up the great work!!",

These diode laser are great TOYS yes toys... they are great sweet toys to learn laser cutting to use Lightburn but they are absolutely unusable to anything serious. After half year I bought a 50W CO2 laser and the difference is DAY and NIGHT. If you want to cut out anything complicated with a diode laser you have to wait 2-3 hours... the CO2 is exactly 10X faster which is a LOT. Without air assist and what is even more important without smoke sucking!!!!  People cannot imagine how much smoke these machines generate, you cannot stay in the same room if you are cutting wood or plastic for longer times..... Soo please people don't believe anybody if you really want to cut than save up for a CO2 machine. (Yes I know it cost 6-7X more but it worth it) These diode lasers are a waist of money... and no they will not be stronger the two diode versions are quite expensive with 10W makes the CO2 almost cheap. Only one thing which is slightly better with the diode laser is the the kerf (cutting width) is slightly smaller (but also not circular but like rectangle). Think long term go with CO2...",

It's an effective ground fault path back to the  source, utility.\nStatic and lightning discharging back it's source, Earth through the ground rod.\n\nThanks for the awesome video 👍",

With CO2-lasers the air assist near or on the nossle is for clearing the smoke and fumes, so the beam is unobstructed for a sharper, better result and the focusing lens gets less wear due to particles sticking to it and burning in. In the video you mention air assist, or lack thereof, on diode lasers, but as a lacking safety feature for putting out fires.. Is the use of air assis that different in the two types? In my experience the air assist can promote the opposite, as it fans any fire, adding more oxygen.",

Cost seems massively higher than it needs to be, I would rather the 3 or 4 otur master Pros you can get for the same price.\n\nThe combined diode sounds cool though but it's not the equivalent of a co2 due to the frequency of the light, need mentioned cutting optically clear items but you can't do that with a blue light diode....",

    "comment_text": "Hi Brandon, I have to say, you are the only person that I watch when it comes to laser talk. Though I know nothing of the machines and most of what you speak of is a foreign language to me, I enjoy watching them all the same. With that being said,  I am seriously in need of suggestions because I have absolutely no idea what I need to purchase, especially since I have never laid eyes on a laser/engraver in my life.\r\nWhichever one I purchase will be going inside my craft room in my house. The room is 25 ft long X 13.5 wide so space is not an issue, however, the entrance to my house is only 34” wide, so it would have to be small enough to go through the entrance.\r\nIn no particular order, these are the things that I would love to learn to create… Jewelry pieces (namely earrings) from wood, leather, and acrylic. I’d like to be able to cut out the wood to assemble jewelry boxes, shadow boxes, keepsake boxes, small-medium-sized desk organizers, and similar items. I would also like to be able to learn how to make round door signs (at least 15”), 3D layered designs and other wall decorative items.\r\nI would love to be able to learn how to engrave on leather and acrylic, books, personalize journals, wallets, and a few other items. I am not new to crafting, just new to laser cutting/engraving.\r\nI would greatly appreciate all suggestions that could help me make my final decision as well as any other equipment that could help make things run smoother and of course, the more budget-friendly it is, the better.",

You're the gold standard when it comes to laser reviews on youtube.\nI've been on the market for a laser for quite a while now and can't seem to make up my mind, so I really appreciate these vids.\nI know I want a dual diode laser. My 1st choice right now is atomstack x7 as they now are promising air assist to be released for it soon. Neje was on my radar, but their setup seems very \"janky\" and I've heard they're overdriving their diodes way too high = shorter lifespan.",

Can you cut dry erase foam board with out melting the centre foam, or how bad does it melt or make a mess of it. If it doesn't wreck it, since the foam board is not perfectly flat how big a variance can you have with out having a major issue. I presume it would affect the focus? Just shopping and like the power of this X7 Pro. one last question will you be showing any laser cutter with the auto head adjuster like the one you mention in this video. Thanks in advance",

My other half and sister in law do a lot of sewn products for people, and being able to laser cut when you need 50 of the same pattern cut at a time is a huge timesaver.  It cost me around $1000 in parts to build plus a lot of time, but even a diode unit that large would be a few thousand dollars minimum.  I could have dropped that price by 3d printing more parts instead of using aluminum for 99% of the machine.\n\nI recognize that is not a good option for most people though.",

Speed doesn't matter for me, but the quality of the cut and the lifetime of the machine. What is your advice? Thank you very much.",

I had pretty much decided on the Atomstack A5 Pro until I saw this video, and so glad I did!  The question I have is, can you please clarify the differences, if any, in the Atomstack models X7, A10, and S10?  I'm getting conflicting information from sellers.  Some say there is no difference in the three except for the color of the unit.  Another says \"S10 Pro is improved performance in all aspects than X7, also it can engraving material including wood, glass, stainless steel, acrylic, etc. and with faster speed and more better results.  This will be a better choice for all engraving and cutting enthusiasts.\"  My head is spinning and I figure if anyone can get to the bottom of this, you can!  :)  Thank you!!",

A 3-hour project will now take 12 hours which is huge if you have to stand watching the machine (as most hobby users do). Not to mention the extra power usage...\n\nThey made 4 and 5 axis hobby cnc machines useless by removing that functionality completely. This limits what you can make regardless if it's a one-off hobby job or full production. \n\nManual tool changes have been made needlessly arduous as they now require a whole new operation.\n\nThey could have achieved the stated goal by simply limiting the hobby version to only posting to Mach 3 and Linuxcnc which no commercial VMCs use. \n\nMost of what they removed has nothing to do with commercial operations. It looks more aimed at forcing hobby users to pay for expensive subscriptions for the small handful of personal projects they do.",

I don’t want to buy one only to realize I need a bigger one etc. I also don’t want to buy industrial only to get bored with producing products. I don’t mind spending 20-25K setting up shop with tools that I will need to do the work correctly. I do have a bunch of carpenter tools for rough work but nothing really for finish work. So I will continue my research in what tools I will need to enter into this field. Now having said that, I am impressed so far with the Glowforge Pro Laser Cutter. Will that be my first purchase? I don’t know. I want to check out your other reviews as well as other folks reviews on the different brands. I will also be looking if someone did a video on complete tools to setup a shop needed. This machine sounds pretty simple and that’s good for an old guy like me. If you have any suggestions or links I will check them out. Thank you.",

As recently as 9 months ago, xTool was heavily promoting their D1 and D1 Pro lasers, yet if one visits their site now, ALL of the replacement parts are \"out of stock\", and none of the laser heads can be replaced, with the exception of the $1,200 40w head for the D1 Pro.\n\nSo if your machine breaks, be aware you cannot get parts to repair it. This seems to be true for all xTool products, and I think a 2 year (maximum) service life is preposterous for a tool at this price-point.",

Been thinking about getting a k40 to tinker with once I get a little more stuff done with my current laser- I love customizable hardware so I see that part as a plus, you get to know your hardware by upgrading/fixing it which makes any problems in the future much easier to diagnose and fix easily, without that understanding a Person often ends up just throwing out perfectly good things- I dumpster dived for a while and the stuff you find is really crazy sometimes- it's just a bit too inconsistent to be feasible where I live. I LOVE this laser stuff though! Wish I'd gotten into it a long time ago!",

The manufacturers web sites also don't generally show anything with any detail. I can only conclude these non-industrial laser engraving machines in general don't do a good job. I think anybody shopping for any laser engraver should see results in person with the products they want to engrave.",

You are telling us this or that machine is the one to buy.  so I would think if people buy on your word you are the one they will blame when the product is I don't know junk might fit for a descrition. I mean you are saying what to buy.",

But like the S1 on the P2 they are telling what is important to them and not for me as the customer. Why not have a red dot laser pointer? Why not allowing me to frame?  They say camera is better, however the fish is not that accurate. The 2nd close up camera is better, but still mediocre+ at best.",

Seems like they're trying to push people into buying this new unit. It would also be nice if they offered the ability to step down the 40w laser to 20w for finer engraving like other laser diode makers are doing, but it seems like they're more interested in getting their customers to buy an entirely different laser module... another upsell. \nWhat would be nice is to see a comparison of this unit to your favorite budget CO2 laser. It feels like this is getting expensive enough that it would be easy to jump to a goob budget friendly CO2 instead.",

Caught myself a few times with goggles where i saw a blue flash in the corner of my eye when i was turning to walk to my laser. \nHonestly will probably upgrade to this, just for better safety but need to save up first the m1 already broke the bank and honestly dont feel as safe with it any more\n\nI do really like the camera on the M1 however and its useful for auto focus and potitioning the work piece and designs as i have my pc wirelessly connected in another room. \nHaving to manually measure and probe when i want to get in a specific spot seems like a downside but ill take better safety to be honest.",

    "comment_text": "I find it crazy that people buy into the unshielded lasers expecting anything good to come of it. The only laser cutter/engraver I have experience with was a massive unit with full shielding and multiple warning stickers about the dangers of laser radiation. These unshielded units are either not powerful enough to do what they advertise, or they are dangerously leaking radiation into your surroundings and you should probably discontinue using it. Generally, a laser above 5mw is enough to cause eye damage if directly shone into your eyes, and lasers above around the 250mw range can cause temporary eye damage indirectly in large exposure. Above 500mw, the damage is permanant. \n\nThese units are often claiming their lasers are \"40W\", which is 80 times the limit for permanent eye damage. This makes the lasers about 9 times more dangerous to handle for the end user. At this level, indirectly viewing the beam or the landing point of the beam will damage your eyes, likely permanantly. The wave length of the laser doesn't change much about the danger to your eye sight, as even undetectable in the UV and IR wave lengths will blind you. Non-visable-light-based lasers (say that 5 times fast) are often more dangerous as you don't even have any reflexes to mitigate the damage. Visable light lasers will cause your eye to reflexively close, which limits the exposure time and chance of blindness. IR and UV wavelengths don't trigger this response, so you won't know anything is wrong until your eye starts hurting which means the exposure time is already exceeding three times the normal amount for visable light, if not more so. Don't cheap out on laser tech, it's dangerous.",

Its for my classroom so needs to fit as a desktop unit and I was lookign at the p2 or the flux hexa\n\nMy main interest is getting a machine that can cut ~1/8 mdf faster and it is hard to get a comparison of cutting speeds (we do alot of layered designs). I was hoping the p2 or flux hexa or other desktop style co2 lasers would be significantly faster than the glowforge pro if anyone can point to evidence for that I would appreciate, thank you.",

So to replace your tube cost you a few thousand dollars, or a bearing, or any other part you can't get from somewhere else.\n\n2. One thing I that wasn't clear in the \"Connectivity\" section, which machines force you to be connected to their cloud before they let you use it?  That is a HUGE deal breaker for me.  If the internet, or your router, or their server, is down so is your laser???  Not going to happen.  \n\nIf a company has that much control over whether or not you can use your machine that will eventually come around to screw you, guaranteed.  At some point that company is going to want you to pay for it's cloud, meaning a new monthly subscription service.  At any time that company could go out of business making your laser a super expensive paper weight.  Look at how many Youtube vids are out there highlighting how their projects were delayed, or completely ruined because Adobe's servers crashed so Premier locked up.  \n\nBoth of these issues make a huge difference in which lasers are usable/affordable.",

    "comment_text": "I was glad to see that you gave Glowforge a 1 star for software, but you didn't really say why.  The reason is because glowforge does not run gcode, it does not and cannot accept gcode, so it's impossible for any software to interface with it.  Everything has to go through their website.  Also you have to pay a monthly fee to do anything but the very basics with their software.  If you want to cut a square, for example, through their software, that is considered a premium feature and you have to pay for that feature.\n\nBut glowforge does do passthrough nicely.\nAlso glowforge has some nice features that you've missed.  For example it detects if you cut anything that will create poison gas that will kill you.  An absolute must if you're going to put this in a classroom where a kid might be vinyl in the machine. That feature alone would make the glowforge the only option for many IMHO.",

The cheaper the entry level into business (and 5K is beyond cheap) the more people are going to be in your space and for that reason...you should really have an idea of how you are going to make a profit BEFORE you buy the laser.  This is way more important than the price differences between the laser.  You can come back from spending to much if you have a great idea.  You will not come back from getting a great deal on a laser if you have no idea how you are going to turn a profit.

I love in the bigger equipment they claim to have the best support, what they mean is the best support if they feel it is convenient for them and no cost to them. They know most can't do anything to hold them accountable for their statements or claims. I found its common for them to do things like if they were advertising a car they would put a 1mm gas line then claim the car travels at 180 MPH when in fact the gas travels at 180MPH down the gas line and not the car.",

Im used to working a Glowforge Pro and im nervous about a steep learning curve with other printers. \nWith that said im really close to pulling the trigger on an Xtool P2 but I discovered the Thunder Laser USA Thunderbolt RF co2 laser and now I'm really torn between the two machines.  I really like that the Xtool looks a lot easier to use than the Thunder Laser and isnt as tall but i want the best machine i can get for what i need.  Quality is super important but i need to be able to use the software too.  \n\nIm really torn as this is a huge investment.  \n\nCurrently i use ImagR to process all of my photos to engrave and import them. \n\nCan you offer your insight?

Even cutting 3mm ply on this is fairly slow 5mm/s 100% power etc. If i look to upgrade in the future im coming back to this video. But for me the Xtool P2 is a very atractive option. \n\nAdditional the Xtool software has come a long way since i first started using it, expecially with setting test grids.",

It's a bit too high to use on most tables, and a bit too low to operate on the floor. But that's literally my only complaint. It's also very heavy - my shop is in my basement and I had to spend another $300 to a moving company to get it down there and into place.",

I have a theory that without this the laser will compensate for the gantry slow speed when accelerating and you will miss the real test value how actually fast you can go. There should be a threshold in the speed chart after which all the squares would look the same in the columns regardless of the speed, so you could see that the laser gantry could not run any faster than the threshold speed.\nI also have falcon2 laser and now I'm eager to do the test as you did here but with \"Constant laser power\" setting on and off. Really good video, thank you for making this.",

So now i mostly wonder if investment into laser cutter would be good idea. Would be cool to make my own detailed components like railing, framing - you get the idea. I need to cut cardboard (not corrugated) thick ranging 0.5 mm - 5 mm ( that's max i think) and some wooden plywood (in some cases). Would you advice something with reasonable price (Say under 1 - 1.5K) ? I cannot justify spent 2k on device i use once a month or so.",

The factor that you didn't mention at all is likely the biggest factor to consider when making this decision... Serviceability.   While the K40 is obviously repairable, since it can be upgraded, it's my understanding that the Glowforge is not serviceable at all.  \n\nLast year I was considering buying a used Glowforge and found dozens for sale.  Thinking that anything bought used would likely at least need a new tube I looked into the cost of parts and the tube.  Turns out you can't buy parts or repair the machine on your own.  If your tube, or any other part, goes out then the only option is to ship the machine back to Glowforge and they will give you a discount on buying a new one.  I couldn't find any other service information so I opted to not get one.  \n\nIt's a truly  horrible policy that makes the Glowforge seem more like a scam than a ligament machine.

Subsequently, I discovered a suitable replacement on Amazon.\n\nIssue 2: Inadequate Laser Engraving\nWhen laser engravings fail to meet expectations, several causes might be at play. These include improper focus, uneven engraving area, or unsuitable materials for engraving.\n\nIssue 3: Mid-Operation Halts\nFrequent occurrences of the machine halting during operations can be attributed to loose connections, faulty motors, or software/firmware glitches. This issue has been highlighted extensively on YouTube.\n\nIssue 4: Subpar Engraving Quality\nSubstandard engraving quality can arise due to incorrect settings, a dirty lens, or a malfunctioning laser module. To rectify this, adjustments in settings, proper lens maintenance, and considering the laser module's condition are recommended.\n\nIssue 5: Smoke and Odor Production\nDuring operation, the machine emitting smoke or strong odors might be a result of a dirty lens, improper settings, or insufficient ventilation. This concern is commonplace among lasers, particularly during cutting. Installing proper external ventilation and employing an enclosed setup are advised solutions.\n\nIssue 6: Unusual Motor Noises\nMotors emitting abnormal sounds during operation may be attributed to loose connections, inadequate lubrication, or faulty motors. Similar observations have been shared on YouTube. A common cause was Ortur's inadequate tightening of drive sprocket set screws, resulting in loosening.\n\nIssue 7: SD Card Recognition Failure\nWhen the machine fails to recognize an SD card, possible reasons include a faulty SD card, corrupted files, or firmware complications. Contacting Ortur for assistance may lead to unresponsiveness, as evidenced by my own experience.\n\nIssue 8: Machine Freezing During Operation\nMachine freezing mid-operation may stem from software/firmware glitches, motherboard issues, or communication problems between the machine and the computer. Establishing a reliable link between my Ortur LM-3 and my computer proved to be a major struggle. Despite weeks of effort and assistance from Ortur, I ultimately sold my brand-new machine at a loss due to this issue.\n\nIssue 9: Inconsistent Engravings\nInconsistent engraving results might result from incorrect settings, a dirty lens, problematic materials, or a malfunctioning PWM (pulse width modulated) laser power controller. Obtaining assistance from Ortur for this issue was often challenging.\n\nLack of Customer Support and Service\nIn terms of customer service and support, Ortur falls significantly short. Despite purchasing their hardware, I received no aid when problems arose. Requests for help went unanswered, and defective parts were disregarded. Unfortunately, Ortur seems unwilling to invest in its customers' needs or satisfaction.\n\nPersonal Experience with Ortur LM-3\nMy excitement for the Ortur Laser Master 3's potential to enhance my workshop quickly turned to disappointment and frustration. Despite its promising appearance, I encountered only obstacles and minimal assistance from Ortur. Their lone response directed me elsewhere for help. Ultimately, after exhausting various resources without resolution, I was forced to sell the Ortur LM-3 at a substantial loss, leading to the demise of my aspirations.\n\nAn Urgent Recommendation\nGiven my ordeal, I strongly advise considering alternative options before investing in an Ortur product. It is my hope that you avoid supporting a company that displays such an evident lack of commitment to both product quality and \ncustomer service.\n\nParting Thoughts\nI am not inclined to write negative reviews, but I felt compelled to share my experience as a cautionary tale for others. Thank you for taking the time to read my account, and I sincerely wish you success in your pursuit of a laser product that truly meets your expectations.",

Reputable companies (J-Tech Photonics and Gweike Cloud, for example) do not do this. Yes, Atomstack buries an optical output power deep in their text, but I wouldn't trust it to be accurate given how dishonest they are in the rest of their advertising (for example, 48W for the X40 MAX is **obvious** BS to anyone familiar with diode lasers). In my opinion, we should boycott all laser manufacturers that even mention the power consumption, given how much it misleads many buyers. And, I want to see them show the ACTUAL laser output power being measured with a power meter (again, J-Tech and Gweike Cloud do this).",

Not sure how good the IR head is because it’s dreadfully slow but it does allow me to mark on materials the blue diode can’t touch. Love the channel and thanks for the brilliant reviews and knowledge base.",

I recently bought an AF2028-60 from them. When it arrived it was instead a usb-0705-u1. Instead of the 600mm/s time of the machine advertised, it was  listed at 500mm/s. I contacted customer service and they said I got an upgraded model. But if so why is it slower. It seems more likely to me someone either screwed up or sent me an older model and thought I wouldn't notice. Any advice you've got would be appreciated. Love your channel by the way.",

    "comment_text": "Got my laser off eBay, 100W tube, 900x600 huge area, Autofocus, rotary axis, 900mm/s max speed in stock configuration. Paid $2000 delivered, earned probably $6000 with it already. All these machines that you test are just fancy toy machines for people who know nothing about technology really. Hardly upgradable too. That tiny area is probably barely going to cover needs of a housewife, and don't even get me started of how much these companies are charging hamsters for their K40 $300 equivalent toys. If I wanted to spend a $3000+ on a CO2 laser, I would just build a freaking servo driven 150W  1m2 monster. They way people waste money is just hilarious. I mean, same people buy carton sheds in usa for $500000, what can you expect from them after that lol. The only thing I truly hate about all industrial lasers is a very stupid controller and a software, RUIDA controllers absolutely suck and they are supposedly the best around, so everything else is even worse apparently. I'd love to have some opensource FW options to be able to tinker and add more features to industrial lasers.",

But. further on in their spec sheet they say it comes with a 12v 5 Amp power supply.... eye roll.... yes, that is a 60 watt power supply.... so I really don't know where they get 130W from.... Anyway, it is their spec, you are being true to what they give out.      On the co2 equivalent, the Epilog 75watt I had use of for a few years, required 240v and required a 15A circuit, so perhaps they should say it was a 3.6 Kilowatt machine.... I must say though, I am pretty impressed by these little laser machines, and they do some stuff better than a co2, just slower",

Not sure if that's a thing that is ever used with the cheaper lasers. Or, honestly, even the larger ones. I've never used a CO2 laser. I've found I get much better engraving results (or at least have to sand a lot less) if I don't use air for my engraving, or I use really minimal air. Really dig the channel and reviews. Thanks 🙂",

One thing I never see mentioned is diode laser life. My x20 has reduced in power by about a third (according to my cut tests) with only 10s of hours on it. It's not a dirty lens/lens protector or S30 setting issue. They have agreed for me to send it back (after copious amounts of poor and repetitive formulaic email support). On the whole I'm not impressed with the build quality. The focus adjustment is sloppy (the addon z-height adjuster requires moving the M2.5 tapped holes for a limit switch), my x-axis eccentric nut was over tightened at the factory which damaged the v-wheels and I had to replace them. The cable management is poor. My next laser is going to be the Roly 20 or 40W. The Roly10W build quality is amazing and their tech support is first class.",

But after reading the manual, im super scared of random reflections from the laser bouncing out of the engraver. The manual says to always wear glasses, is it really necessary? I thought I would be able to look through the glass lid while the machine is engraving ... Do I only need glasses for this? What if I open up the tray and use the pass through, or the rotary tool, does the opening at the front of the laser leave me susceptible to laser reflections and  possible burns or blindness? I know it may seem like i'm being overly paranoid, but these are the things the warning labels talk about, yet I see people operate them online as if closing the lid is more than enough. I even saw one man stoop down and get eye level with the laser as it engraved a glass cup, the front of the engraver was exposed and open. I'm a complete novice and have no basis as to what is normal to do or not to do. I would truly appreciate your insight on this.",

A 100watt Thunder has 10-20% more power than a 100watt Omtech or similar laser. As a example if you buy a 100 watt co2 laser from most manufacturers the tube has a MAXIMUM output of 100 watts but you are only recommended running them at 90% of the advertised power. Thunder Laser USA sell 100watt lasers with a usable output of 100watts. They throttle the power back from (in my case) 118 watts maximum output and this allows you to set the power to 100% in lightburn and get a true 100watt output with no risk of damage to the tube.",

I don't understand why the doors are keyed when the main lid isn't. \n\nThe other issue is not having a guide that corresponds to the bounds of the cutting area. For example, you will see a ruler on the X and Y axis. You can push material up to it and know exactly where it is every time. Trotec and epilog both have ruler guides in some of their cutting tables.\n\nEveryone's got a different workflow though. I personally use absolute coords 98% of the time.

Is easy to open to change filter, and looks nice. Build quality feels a bit cheap, but ok enough. I definetly recommend extraction fumes outside, but it works fine if you can accept some smell when cutting acrylic.",

    "comment_text": "I'll admit, the features are great, but as usual, they are extremely overpriced for consumers.  Sadly, they are still using low quality laser tubes and mirrors. You are basically paying 2000$ for shipping software.  The cooling system is sub par, and being locked into their software to use the features is a gimmic.   If this company really wanted a consumer audience,  they would work with the popular sw companies to integrate the support they provide and also sell a product with better hardware.   This laser is being sent out in hopes to nab a few 1 off customers but geared at businesses that do not know better or want a mini laser farm.  Not including the software or time, an identical laser built with better quality parts would cost about 2k currently.   Yes it would not look as nice, but 3000$ extra just so you don't have to alignment your work is insane.  Also any business that would be using lasers, will definitely be concerned about time and ensure to align everything well to get the most bang for their buck.\n\nIn short... great idea, horrible price, wrong targeted market.\n\nUse better hardware and reduce the price by 50% and then you will be in the right audience and market.",

All things considered, the P2 seems like a step up from the OMTech Polar but one thing that I think you failed to mention in the price comparison is that the Rotary for the P2 is an additional cost, whereas the rotary is included in the cost of the Polar. In your prior reviews it seems like you are pretty high on the Polar. All things considered, which of the two would you personally recommend (I know everyone's needs are different, looking for your choice personally). To add to that, if space is not a constraint, is there are full size laser in the price range of the Polar and P2 that you would recommend above the others?",

The example engraving you showed wasn't nearly large enough to make use of the speed. That is, as soon as it gets to the engrave, it should already start slowing down. Now, to bypass that, there's the overscan area, which is this case is excessively large because it needs a long time to reverse that heavy head. \n\nLong story short; Top speeds are nice and all, but pretty meaningless without high accelerations to make use of it.",

All the reviews i have seen keep showing a window with pre set calculations as a guide to show you what the settings should be for different materials...mine does not have any such window!  The hardware looks good but it can only excel if its software is well thought out...THIS ISN'T. it is very frustrating and to cap it all i have just tried to leave a product review on Amazon but strangely Amazon keep telling me they can't find the product i purchased new just one week ago?.. all my other purchases are still there waiting to be reviewed .I I wonder if they are getting a lot of returns.",

    "comment_text": "I have a project which is going to involve making a lot of small custom designed parts made from aluminium and also carbon fiber.  One of my friends was recommending I look at diode lasers.  However these are really bad a cutting aluminium and carbon fiber is really hard.  I've seen the fiber lasers are much better for aluminium.  There is also some evidence from youtube the fiber lasers can also now cut carbon fibre.  However, I can't find many reviews using the fiber lasers to cut carbon fibre.  In short, I'm wondering if only a MOPA fiber laser can cut carbon fiber?  If you could let me know your thoughts that could make a big difference to me.  Looks like the 'Max' fiber lasers are also best avoided!",

You have to have parts from an earlier purchased engraver to make this run.  I wish I had known this.  Who does business this way?  So now I have to either spend another $1,100 to buy parts I will put aside and not use or refund and lose some of my hard earned money.  Ugh!!!!!",

    "comment_text": "Thank you for the information. Being very new to fusion setups, my next question may seem obvious. For the adaptive clearance cnc bit - one obviously needs to probe Z top height and X & Y outer corners (based on the stock corner chosen or box point); but for the parallel path the cnc bit is changed to a bullnose - and while one does need to probe again Z tool height again, do we also need to probe the outer corners X & Y again? .....It can get a little confusing when you consider that the silhouette cut for the adaptive clearance bit is set to \"tool outside boundary\", while the parallel path bullnose bit chosen is set to \"tool centre on boundary\". Does fusion just do the calculation for you when you go from one bit to the next \"for the x & y box point\", or does one have to probe X & Y again (in addition to Z) for each cnc bit change?",

I am not really a big fan of the glowforge due to the price and the monthly subscription... ridiculous! But I'd really appreciate it if you could point me in a the direction of an autofocusing laser!

Another was the Excellon Cobra which had both UV and CO2 in 1 machine so you could cut/skive/drill with one and do a finish pass with the other.

What are the replacement cost for the laser, airlifters etc.  I know we are comparing a diode to a Co2 but I am not sure which is better for a beginner. Until now I thought Glow forge was my only options for a self contained desktop laser with a camera and easy to use, now there is a choice, so the question is which one. Thoughts?",

Some diode lasers are advertised to be able to run up to 24000mm/min, which is equal to 400mm/s, so theoretically they could do the same as CO2 laser. Perhaps in case of 300mm/s even 40w optical power would not be enough fo good result, but I am confused why people are not running such tests on yt - usually they go up to 10000mm/min.",

Its been my workhorse for the small things I make, but has recently started stopping mid burn on everything even after multiple attempts with cleaning, customer support assistance, etc. So I decided I want to upgrade and was considering the 40w, but xtool is telling me I need to purchase a pro AND then the 40w like you said in the video. Kind of pointless to buy the pro when its only for the rail system and it would be waste of the laser. I wish they offered a complete 40w kit. Im considering throwing my hat into the co2 ring and going with an Omtech 50w. Currently its $250 off so its pretty close to the same price if I would purchase the pro and then the 40w upgrade. Whats your opinion? Keep up the videos too! Theyre very informative!",

I got an Omtech 60w and sold it within a year because of this. I have a small shop and couldn't afford the space. I love my atomstack x20, and getting a 40w will be a huge game changer.",

I would like to improve speed with both engraving & cutting (I mainly engrave ceramic tiles, slate & mirror, but also glass & stainless steel) & would like to cut 4-6mm ply/mdf/acrylic. Would the RF CO2 laser still get similar quality on engravings at a much faster speed & would cutting be a lot better with the glass tube C02? Also, when engraving ceramic/acrylic/glass etc do C02 lasers still need the various paints to mark/burn materials? Thanks for this video btw (been waiting for your opinion)",

I have a scroll saw, table saw, miter saw, router, dremel, jig saw/ basically everything but a CNC machine. What work we do is resin art and wood work for home decor. What would be the best user friendly but cuts what we need? I’m wanting more of a wood cutter and not an engraver. Yes? That would be a plus, but I’m wanting to cut words/fonts out of wood and put it on other items to paint or resin. (ie- welcome sign). Clearly I don’t need 7k+ type machine so what would you suggest for someone that does my line of work at home?",

With diodes you can mask the material and it stops charring on the back of the item.  Is this needed on CO2 devices?  Do you also need to get the honeycomb to protect the materials?  If not this may be savings between the different operations of units.  For sure leaning towards the Gweiki..thanks",

    "comment_text": "I think there is a lot of nuance in getting the right laser cutter. The Polar looks like an interesting machine and I might be interested if I was getting something for my house. I'm a teacher and the Glowforge works best for my classroom. The footprint is just right for the classroom (looks similar to the Polar). The web interface is a selling point, allowing us to manage multiple users easily and not worry about software. I only use the interface to set up my cuts, where the camera is very useful. Everything else is done in Illustrator, Inkscape, or Vectornator. The subscription is completely optional and unnecessary. Respectfully, the review makes it sound almost required - that is simply incorrect. I have 5 Glowforges (the plus model). They are used constantly, the oldest being 3 years old, and I have never had a serious problem with any of them. Support was quick and helpful when an issue did present itself, the GF was cutting again by the end of the day. It is a no fuss machine - and that is what I need when working with 100 students each quarter. If I were buying a hobby machine I would have different requirements, but the Glowforge is pretty awesome for us. Just wanted to provide a different perspective/experience.",

The M1 spec states a 385x300mm (15x12 inch) working area, but is that the max size of the material sheet BEFORE cutting or just the max size of the cutting area?  For example, can I insert a sheet of 8mm MDF into the unit that is say 400x310mm and then design a shape to cut inside the 385x300 working area?  The reason I ask is that the shape I need to produce could be 300x300mm so it would be nice to be able to rough cut a slightly larger sheet to then make sure the finished shape can be cut out allowing for a small border.  Hope that makes sense?",

Now, the machine no longer fires. The machine homes and \"enables laser\" but not light when framing the project. When I disable fan and hit start, the machine acts like it is firing. I am following the instructions word for word. I have checked the settings. I have reinstalled the software. Looked the FAQ. I have emailed, called and left messages, and did the online chat.  The team seems really nice. I would just like someone to get in touch with me to trouble shoot. I am willing to send my machine back and have them fix it.   I can't recommend this product because the customer service is subpar. I just wanted to make a gift for my two year old. I am happy to update this if I ever get a hold of them.",

I’d like to set the number of measurement points per square cm or at least define a measurement area to ensure the engraving or 3D map is as accurate as possible.\r\n\r\n2. Is there an automated height detection system or any add-ons for soft materials like leaves or flowers, which are difficult to measure with mechanical height detection?\r\n\r\n3. What is the noise level of the machine and the exhaust system? I plan to use it in my home, so that’s important for me.\r\n\r\n4. When working with larger materials that are fed through the machine, is it possible for the engraving or cutting to be automatically detected and seamlessly extended? I’m looking for intelligent software that can adjust the engraving path automatically without needing to manually realign the material.\r\n\r\n5. Do you use or recommend any infeed track with a stopper and optional conveyor belt for precise material alignment and consistent movement at the right angle during the process?\r\n\r\n6. Is there an intelligent function for engraving multiple identical materials? I would like the machine to detect and optimize the engraving process across multiple pieces with identical designs, to save time and ensure consistent results.\n\nI know that the xTool P2S has most of the features I need, and their software is actually quite good. However, it seems that they may have purchased reviews on Trustpilot, and their customer support has been quite disappointing, so I don’t fully trust this company.\n\nI’m also interested in experimenting with inlays in small QR codes, around 30x30mm, where the glass tube CO2 laser might reach its limits. It could be better to go for an RF option, but I’m not sure if Aeon is the right choice for this. You may have a better idea of what would suit my needs best, considering you’ve tested a larger product range and are up to date with the latest technologies.\n\nI’m based in Germany, so it would be good if there aren’t any issues with shipping or customer support, but that’s mostly optional.\n\nBest regards",

This is comparable to lower end CO2 machines. So why not just get the CO2? Well, for one, the cut quality seems to be cleaner with a diode laser, as they usually have smaller kerf and are consistent across the entire work area. The versatility of light cutting up to 15mm and more detailed engraving in a single machine is probably a better option for hobbyists than a small CO2 laser. Or am I wrong and there are CO2 lasers that outperform the engraving quality of diodes?",

After about 2 months I put it under a shelf in my building and haven't touched it since. Creality is an FDM printer company just trying to stay relevant so their support on their lasers are non-existent. Maybe I got a dud, but my friend bought one as well and had a similar experience.

    "comment_text": "Thanks so much for your content. I am a high school science teacher. About two and a half years ago I inherited the school \"design lab\" classroom which contained a glowforge pro.  Since then, I acquired another glowforge (free donation from a parent).  I have spent a great deal of time learning how to operate the machines, run inkscape, adobe illustrator etc.  My students are I are getting pretty good at making the kind of things people would actually buy.  The machines run 2-3 hours a day just about everyday. As problems arise I do my best to troubleshoot and put out fires but this is getting harder and harder.  I've convinced my admin that I am going to need to replace one of both of these machines soon. I am DEFINITELY NOT going with Glowforge again.  Knowing what you know, what would you recommend for a school setting (high school)?",

I'm 69 years old and bought an Omtech Polar when they first came out (expecting to have fun in my retirement years), but it was too unrefined. I unboxed it, bought a couple \"improved\" nozzle assemblies, and the Ruika Controller from Cam Edmonds and then never even turned it on! Luckily I was able to sell it for about 80% of what I had in it. So, the OneLaser XRF will be my first laser. I'll be looking forward to your upcoming Thursday Live again. Thanks, Charlie in Central Ohio, but soon to be Central Florida !!",

I use a boss co2 laser at school where i teach, but this is for me personally. \n\nWould i need to get an air assist? Is that needed, or does the small fan in the laser do enough? 10w would be good enough to small cutting? I don't mind taking a few passes. \n\nAnd the boss laser has an air fan in there, would this just be ok next to an open window and an exhaust fan? I'm thinking about fumes or smoke. \n\nThanks for your great channel!",

I think Xtool appeals to more people because of the ease of use/software and their 3d mapping for curved surfaces. A little learning curve with Lightburn but being new to engraving, its not that bad IMO. Watch a few videos and you are good to go.\n\nI am curious about the noise of the base unit laser one. How loud is it in decibels? How loud when you add in the air assist? Also what type of maintenance is needed for the laser one (weekly, monthly? your recommendations). Also a quick run down for new people like me on what materials you can use with it would have been nice (but I can check the website for that). \n\nI'm looking at getting a laser this Jan or Feb. Considered Roly Lasermatic (larger version) and Xtool but this looks really nice. Will definitely put this on my list as a product to watch.",

Lazer consistency is off sometimes..  speed is at 1900 and power is at 80% ..   Does not always happen.. but just curious what in the world could be going on.. the depth of the engraving is just not consistent ...Air assist is off and over scanning at 2.5%.. could this be something in the \"Common settings\" Maybe the scan angle? the image is in 3 layers..but the setting are the same in all layers..   The layers starts good but then changes occur and you see deeper areas then the rest on that particular layer... Even when i join the entire file as one layer after i group it together..  I aways burn the same image, just change the text in it.. anyone here have any thoughts? thanx.",

I use the laser to fabricate wooden mechanisms using solid hardwoods; typically 1/4 in thick but have used 3/8 and 1/2 inch material (Maple,Oak,Cherry,Walnut). Can this XRF One Laser be used for this type of work? Are there other lenses available to help with the thicker materials? Thanks",

Looking forward to the actual performance of the OneLaser XRT, they advertise 3D Photerealistic accuracy and would like to some before pushing the button.  I was looking at CO2 lasers upgrading from a 10W diode to expand capabilities, big step. I like the fact that the RF, though more expensive, doesn't require the additional cooling requirement in comparing to the CO2 machines.  You mentioned the 3-2-1 warranty, does that mean should the fan on the RF tube or tube itself faults that there is a 3yr warranty on it?  Thanks again for all the great videos and reviews.",

    "comment_text": "Great reviews, and thanks for the details !  I’m totally on board with this ranking. \n\nI had a Polar before—it worked fine at first, but quickly turned into a disaster. The inside of the machine? Constantly filthy. You have to clean the lens every couple of hours to keep it from getting scorched, and the build quality is… let’s just say, not great. I’ve spent so much time on fixing shit, dat I could’ve paid for a whole new machine by now. And customer service? Practically nonexistent. They pass you around, and might call back two weeks later, right after you’ve DIY-fixed the issues.\n\nThe P2S was my top pick—not just for the minor upgrades, but mostly for the bed size (23.6” x 12”) and speed. And let’s be real—their ads are literally everywhere. You can’t escape them! This company must have piles of cash to burn; it’s insane how much they’re pouring into marketing. There are other niche brands like Bolt and Mira, but their bed sizes are too small for my needs, and the pricing is all over the place. Then I saw the ONELASER X, launching right after the P2S, and this new brand checked all my boxes: a bigger bed size (26” x 14”), excellent build quality, twice the speed, a clean cabinet design with an enclosed base, and full US-based support., Honestly, I was nervous about going with a new brand, but now I’m convinced I made the right choice.\n\nHopefully, OneLaser ships my order on time—because that’s the important part they can’t afford to mess up! I mean that seriously.",

    "comment_text": "After watching the product video, I feel confident in this purchase. I really appreciated the clear, up-close views and detailed breakdown, especially around items to consider ordering to be prepared for the machine’s arrival. I'm glad you suggested getting the air assist, setting up proper ventilation, and preparing for fume management. Thanks for the excellent insights—I’m looking forward to working with this machine!\n\nOne of the most innovative features, and something I find especially valuable, is the built-in air quality indicator. This sensor is a game changer, allowing real-time air quality monitoring, which is particularly helpful in a closed room with only a window for ventilation. I had been considering purchasing a separate air quality sensor, so having this integrated feature is a fantastic benefit. Given that a lot of our work can produce strong odors, seeing an indicator for particle levels is very helpful for health and safety.",

I wouldn't trust a brand new no-name company with that chunk of money or support, as things with these lasers can definitely go wrong/need replacement parts.\n\nWhy buy from a company thats trying to trim/cheapen the item, when you can literally buy from their supplier?

In my environment those seem pretty common, and I think it's kinda cool that you can get a infrared module for the open gantry type Laser. \n\nIn any case, I'm really appreciating the info you put together here, since I'm in the market for a new diod laser this black Friday. Thanks and keep on going 😊",

So when I get halfway through doing what you showed, I get stuck. How do you line up the taped up image when gluing it down? Do you use some sort of registration marks or are you just eyeballing it? I have a hard time imagining that I am going to be able to line up something even half that complex and get every little part in the right spot just by eyeballing it. Please tell me you had some sort of trick to get over this that was not in the video?",

Instead I use a air value that bypasses  the regular shut off, I use in lightburn  ( and turn off the air when engraving  that and  extra valve allows a small amount of air ( however I much I wish) to pass through the head and keep the lens clear. I got mine at cloudray. (this is a stand feature on thunder lasers. ( I dont have a thunder) if you google you will see it (Cloudray Ultimate Air Assist Set) this was a good video thank you.",

    "comment_text": "First of all, great review and categorization of thoose lasers! However, as a beginner, I feel like some essential information is missing, especially for desktop models. Next year, I plan to start working with small parts, around 1-4 cm thick. I mostly need engraving, and I’d like to work on multiple pieces at once (potentially different sizes but the same height), letting the laser run while I do other tasks. For this, the laser should have the capability to automatically detect the position of the workpieces and center engravings, like texts or QR codes. Otherwise, I would have to manually measure and align each piece to the 0,0 point. For example, if one piece is 50mm wide and another is 52mm wide, and I want a QR code centered, the laser should be able to automatically center it if needed. This is especially important when dealing with multiple pieces lying next to each other. I can't rely on precise X, Y coordinates because the pieces might not always be perfectly aligned, or there could be a 1-2 mm gap between them, which could throw off the centering of the engravings.",

    "comment_text": "I've been watching your stuff for years and really appreciate your videos! I always stop here first when trying to learn about new and innovative lasers on the market. I have an ambitious project idea I was hoping to get your opinion on.  I'm thinking about building a really large work area diode setup for cutting thin fabrics. These will likely be polyester, nylon, and dyneema fabrics for cutting tent patterns. I will need it to have a 72\" usable width for the work area and probably at least 140\" length or the ability to easily and accurately index the next section of the cut (floor panels will commonly be 108\" long and need straight edge cuts). Due to the crazy size, i'm trying to find a way to make it collapsible, something i could put up and take down easily. Another idea might be to rig it to hang from the garage ceiling and drop down as needed. Hoping to go lightweight and establish rigidity with whatever i set it on for cutting (possibly concrete driveway or lightweight ply base if mounting to ceiling). Lastly, it wouldn't hurt to prioritize speed over accuracy as a cut line within an 1/8\" of the intended cut is plenty accurate (no engraving needed with this setup) Any thoughts on how achievable this would be? Not sure how the belt drive accuracy would be at that scale. Also, if you're aware of a smaller machine designed to index quickly/accurately for large prints that you think could work well in this use case, I'd love to hear about it:). Thanks again and care!",

    "comment_text": "The only thing better than having your own laser cutter is having a friend who has a laser cutter.......find a friend who has an Xtool P2 or similar.\n\nFor safety reasons, I will never be anywhere near an open-frame device even if I'm wearing OD6 (or higher) laser goggles. If you have one of these, at least put an enclosure around it. BTW, a pair of laser safety goggles is a lot cheaper than eye surgery, or living the rest of your life with impaired or no vision.\n\nAir-assist. You really need it to reduce the fire hazard, as it squelches flames that try to form while cutting. Remember, a laser cutter works by burning-away material.\n\nSmoke. You dont realize how MUCH smoke gets produced till you do your first cut. Even a few small cuts on thin MDF or plywood will stink-up your entire garage. Which goes back to the first point: You need an enclosure for safety reasons as well as to gather the smoke for your exhaust fan (or air purifier).\n\nCooling. We havn't done any lengthy processing on the P2 yet. It's water-cooled and I've only seen the temp go up 1-2 degrees during usage, even when the laser is running at 100% power. A 55W CO2 laser is around 20% efficient, so you probably have 300 watts coming thru the laser tube. It's going to take awhile for that to heat-up a water tank. But if you're using an air-cooled fiber laser, it's going to heat-up faster even though it's a lot more efficient than CO2. Probably a non-issue for hobby work, because your cutter will pause a few times if it needs to cools-down.",

I went this route about 4yrs ago.  Purchased a 12\" x 20\", 50W sealed tube CO2 machine for about $1200.  It has many of the features of the more expensive domestically sourced (US made) machines.  It's not quite as refined, but it does the job just fine.   Worked for 30yrs in the industrial laser field and this machine, even though it's a lot cheaper, is every bit a \"real\" machine as the more expensive ones.  Though I don't use it for \"production work\", it could...  That said, not sure how long it'll last for with that kind of use, but for hobby users like me, it's the perfect low cost, nearly full featured machine.   The only thing mine doesn't have is a chiller and auto focus.  I use a large bin full of DI water that can be cooled by tossing in a few frozen bottles of bottled water.  Though it doesn't have auto focus, it does have a manual Z-axis table feature and I use a dial indicator to set the height based off the material thickness used.\n\nAgain...  Great and very informative video.  Continue to be amazed at the scope and quantity of equipment available to hobbyists these days!",

    "comment_text": "As a Glowforge Pro owner, there are a couple things that you did omit. I have looked at light burn and believe that I could certainly use it. But, for hobbyists and those who are not using their laser printer day in and day out, Glowforge has a remarkably easy to use interface, one that my mother could figure out.\n\nAnd let's not forget, Apple made there reputation based on software interface and ease of use .\n\nBut that said, the detractors are significant and includes several you missed. Important among them is the fact that you have to pay $240 per year just to be able to save your files to the cloud. Because they have you locked in, any file or project you create will disappear within 30 days unless you pay them their ransom. \n\nFurthermore, and this is a very little known issue, there is absolutely no way to save a project from glowforge's cloud to your desktop or any local storage device. This means that if you spend your time setting up the perfect print and go forage, you can forget about saving it unless you are paying their yearly subscription fee. I am so surprised that nobody has mentioned this as I quit paying my yearly subscription fee and lost hundreds of project files. \n\nSimilar to this videos conclusion, I would not recommend this product to anyone at any price.",

Absolutely not made for professional use and even less for private use. Way too loud, poor cooling, extremely difficult to maintain if something breaks. And the worst part: the exhaust. When you use this laser, everything smells. It’s not sealed. This laser is far too expensive, and I would always prefer the Turbo 535 from Omtech. This laser is a marketing gimmick and not recommended.",

Folk won't \"upgrade\" from a $4000 machine to a $4500 machine because it has a better fan and improved software for cups.... would they??",

The camera will always move a tiny bit out of calibration.\nNot only that, but even if you really mount it as sturdy as possible and have the same thickness of material all the time, it will just by itself loose calibration within 2-3 runs.\nNot only that, even if you use fixed jigs (no camera), the laser itself isn't consistent in positioning, you may get 2-5mm shifts randomly.\n\nSo all in all the Lightburn camera alignment feature is just a collosal disappointment.\n\nIs that what you show in the video - randomly positioned material with accurate detection and accurate positioning - REALLY REALLY reality or is that staged B.S.? Does it REALLY get the content onto the material in the right angle, in the right place?\nCan there be a proper review of this feature, please?\n\nThanks!",

The crafter machines are getting multifunctional with printing/blade cutting modules, while the hobby ones focus on lasers.\n\nInstead of having an always ticked \"enclosure\" column, you should add important parameters missing from your sheet:\n* how the focus works: by moving the module or bed - as this limits functionality, you can't easily do curved surface processing when the whole bed has to move up and down\n* rotary attachment support - out of the box, with optional riser base, etc.\n* pass through / removable bottom plate\n\nBTW as far as I know WeCreat somehow shot off xTool (ex employees?) - their software is basically a clone of xCS 1.x.\nBTW2 you could have waited with this until the P2S review.",

The advertised spot size was .1mm - .15mm. In your experience, is this a common problem for higher-watt diode lasers, or did I just get a lemon?",

They were SUPER helpful for learning and mastering Lightburn, but I was wondering if you are planning on doing any more that are specific to the Polar. I haven't found anyone else on youtube who is as easy to follow as you and who is covering the polar. This isn't our first rodeo- our main laser is an old beast from a defunct company in China, but sometimes all the bells and whistles are almost more complicated. I'd love to see videos on the camera, or more explaining how to use the z axis. I've got engraving down, but we're struggling with cutting through material in a reliable way. Thank you for all the videos you made so far!",

When I did auto trace, it traces both sides of the lines of the bit map design, which causes the laser to cut line, then cut again a fraction over. I thought it was mistakenly set to more than one pass, but it wasn’t. I zoomed in and that’s when I saw that auto trace ended up tracing both sides of the single lines.  Is there anyway to keep it from tracing both sides of one line? Ok, sorry, I’m sure that didn’t make much sense.  🤷‍♂️",

Are you able to have multiple modules in at one time, or not switch out bases, specifically for printing/cutting sticker paper which is thinner than wood? The switching of modules and bases would throw off indexing for the job. I understand there is a framing function for alignment. How accurate is framing function, how long does it take, how does its alignment compare to cricut/cameo which uses registration marks for alignment? Curious if the machine could print/cut decals well with good alignment and repeatability.  Lots of questions, but appreciate the response -- thanks!",

After a few weeks/months they came up with \"addons\" they should have been part of the machine from the start on. \n\nHoneycomb on the M1, the Extension for the M1, the rotary tool 2, after you recently bought der v1 that was not that long on the market, ...\n\nAnd shortly after you bought a machine, they release the next one and \"forget\" about the old one ... to this day there is no fucking posibility to use Lightburn with the M1 (just with the Laser, i know that the cutting will not work with Lightburn). With the build in camera you're fucked if it comes to Precision. That Fisheye Lense didn't give you a chance if you try to engrave precicley. So let me use coordinates instead for god sake ...\n\nWith these Earley Adopter Machines we have financed all the \"ultra\" machines. Fine. They could make also an Pen-Holder, Embossing-Tool or something for the M1 - but ... I understand, that they want to make money. \n\nBut in the future, i'll wait and think twice about any buying decision.",

    "comment_text": "PLEASE! PLEASE! DO NOT BUY - I have spent about $3000 with Xtool - I purchased the D1Pro and some other stuff almost a year ago and I have had nothing but issues. Trying to work with Customer Service is INSANITY! I also purchased the Infrared, and it has never worked. I was told by Xtool \"Regarding the problem of the infrared laser head, many customers will not be able to use it successfully due to improper operation.\" So even if you follow their instructions and use the samples they sent, you still maybe doing something wrong. What are you doing wrong?--- you don't know, and they don't either, so you end up with a $500 paper weight. I watched tons of Youtube reviews on the D1Pro and they all gave glowing reviews; so, I went with it. Unfortunately, I and many others have not had the same success with Xtool as indicated in the Youtube reviews. After so many issues I decided to invest in another laser and speaking to some of Xtool competitors I asked question in hope that I don't end up with $3000 paper weights. The most chilling thing discovered was they are aware of Xtool and the issues the customers face. I noticed that a lot of the issues I've had with Xtool out the gate without me asking any questions they spell out what the machine can and can't do, their customer service and support. One guy said their Support Agents respond with 4 to 9 minutes and they quickly resolve your issue because they understand many of their customer use it for business purposes. Better than the 24 to 72 hours waiting for Xtool to respond and two weeks later you are still no where close to a resolution. OH, and those that have State side support definitely let you know that.\r\n\r\n I really don't want anyone to encounter this; because when you are not a wealthy person $3000 is a huge investment for you. PLEASE when researching for purchase do more than watch YouTube videos; it could save you time, money and peace of mind. PLEASE be sure to ask about customer service\\support, warranty, replacement parts. A big one would be \"What issues are commonly encountered by customers and how do you work to resolve those issues? \r\n\r\nI saw a post on Facebook asking, \"Why are so many people selling their Xtool?\" I laughed because I was looking to see how easy it would be to sell it. RFLOL \r\n\r\nWhen you have a quality product it is GREAT! I really enjoy engraving, cutting and making things it is so therapeutic. DON\"T FORGET to be diligent in your research.",

So my question/s 1) Can a riser be installed like on the M1 for a rotary attachment. 2) Is there a pass through or is it limited to just one size. 3) what is the max working area? 4) Have you received any information about an IR module option. 5) Does this work through the XTool Creative Space Software and Lightburn 6) Which Filter is needed to run indoors, is it the same as the F1 or does it require the large 699.00 model. 7) what type of ink cartridge is used for the printing and what type of ink is used. 8) What modules come with the base product. 9) Will it work with the screen printer.  10) If no camera will it use the iPhone option like the S1 can do now because the teaser ad shows batch printing so curious how that works. Ok so lots of questions I know but trying to decide do I pass this up and just get the S1. I hate that neither have the camera yet they installed the camera on the M1. I sometimes wonder what they are thinking when designing these machines. For a few bucks more it would be a real game changer had they added it. It looks similar to the Glowforge Aura but that does have the camera and pass through, but no rotary.",

Personally I would leave out packaging cost because that can be put into your shipping price, that the customer pays. \n\nI would add in misc business costs as a % on top - rent, supplies, kitchen, cleaning, insurance, registrations, safety equipment etc.\n\nAs for laser time, i've found that it is unrealistic unless it is the ONLY factor in pricing a custom one off job. A lot of people online use laser time but if you're also factoring machine cost, maintenance and labour, then counting laser time is basically double charging (in terms of working out your costs). \n\nHowever it does work in figuring out how to price a custom jobs on the fly, where you aren't making the same kind of item hundreds of times.\n\nUltimately if you are making at least 3-4x the cost of materials then you're doing alright.",

The hight of materials, as well as potential waviness, seem very restricted! Many other cheaper diode lasers have auto leveling via stepper motor and height detection DURING engraving, and don’t rely on a roller in a specific location.\n\n3.) The overall concept saves storage and transportation space, but is very limiting otherwise. Including (inexpensive) expansion kits, higher power laser modules etc.\n\nInteresting product (for specific applications)!\n\nBest wishes",

There is no offline anything with the m5c which is a joke.The app is completely useless and the files on the app are very few and arent all stl files so you cant directly print 90 percent of those files.. The slicer will tell you 10 hour print and turn into 15 hour print somehow while printing. The fact that the company's on website lies about its own features should be enough to scare anyone away from buying this. And for the price, you can get many different 3d printers that utilize more types of filaments and have some sort of upgrade so your printer can do all the things you want with 10x better slicer. And the m5 is an even bigger joke with a camera that does nothing... I wouldnt recommend this to any entry-level person either because that's just predatory to suggest a bad product to someone who doesn't know any better.",

This means it won't fit most standard duct tubing which is 4 inches or more. I had to print adapters for the S1 and P2. There is no good reason for them not to use the most common size. Though I guess this could be some attempt at proprietary BS so that you have to buy tubing and exhaust accessories from them. 2nd, the implementation of lightburn compatibility is terrible. It's janky as all hell and badly thought out. Plus the camera functions of the P2 never worked in lightburn for me. If I could do it again, I would go with a company like Thunder Laser. They are also Chinese, but they have USA based support and sales people. So my issues are never brushed aside and the BS claims are less.",

I have used quite a few different software programs to accomplish my goals. I used QGIS for when I needed buildings, Snazzy Maps for streets, roads and highways, finally Open Street Map for a little bit of both. Snazzy is the easiest but you can’t export SVG files for editing, nor does it do buildings at the resolution I need. QGIS and Open Street Map both do buildings but have Steeper leaning curves with multiple steps and that slows down my workflow. I would love to offer custom maps, but the time it takes me to design one map, to sell that one map, makes it a poor financial decision (time is money). I have other products that are far easier to make, and therefore more profitable. If Laser Map Maker is easier to use and can draw up buildings and exports SVG files, then I can make custom maps faster and make more money, then it is a good deal to me.",

Mine has issues and they send me parts to fix it myself. This will shut your business down during the months it takes to get it back.  If you have critical failure they will replace once you send yours back and get the replacement.  This will take several more months.  They will let you give them $2500.00 refundable deposit if you have a spare $2500.00 to give them for several months.",

Maybe I'm the only one, but that makes this a non-starter for me. I used to teach laser cutting at a maker space on a $75,000 laser cutter (I did not own it), so I know they can get up there, and I'm sure this one is no where near that. But, I'm not going to jump through hoops to find out.\n\nSome people will say, \"Well, if you have to ask, you can't afford it.\" Except that if you are a small shop, and have a budget, it is actually possible that you could afford it, and you would like to know so you can set aside the money,.......   \n\nIt's more like, \"If your potential customer has to ask, then you probably shouldn't be hiding it.\"",

Personally I always love to listen to reviewers' takes on the machines and I usually form some opinion using an aggregate of reviews. And even this only forms part of my overall opinion. Reviews are great but they never take the place of doing your own hard research. And you have to accept that MOST of these lasers are built in part or in whole in China where the quality is not always consistent. So no matter what you do you may end up with a bad sample of an otherwise good laser. I am much more concerned about the company I am buying from and their customer service than the actual laser itself 99% of the time.\n\nBut that being said I do thing the reviews have value as long as nobody doing them tries to hide the fact that they received the laser for free for review. Honesty and openness are the requirement for these reviews to have any merit. You have never given me any reason to think you are otherwise so I love following your channel.",

    "comment_text": "I watch you regularly, and expected that your knowledge level would be a bit higher. First, she talks about the speed. Owning an Epilog Fusion Pro, I know something about speed. At top speed and max output power, you are hardly leaving a mark on wood. So, the speed argument is a little dumb. The accordions on the side of the gantry to protect the internals of the machine is something Epilog has had for years. The idea that somehow, the autofocus built-in to the lens carriage is something new is also wrong. Epilog, Trotec, and honestly several others I can think of have been doing that for years. Servo motors? Welcome to 2020. Let's talk resolution. 1000 DPI, is nowhere near class-leading. She talks about how happy she is about how rigid they are, being built of steel. Why did they add several hundred pounds to the machine by cheapening out with steel when they should have gone with military grade aluminum. I notice that my Epilog is under 300 pounds while the Aeon with the same bed size is 550 pounds. Some of them go up to 1,500 pounds. She talks about being able to change frequency, well I am not certain, but I think several companies have had that for years. I know I can change that on mine. The drop-in water cooled tube that doesn't change alignment is cool, bravo on that point! Even if you could buy one, (many people can not get a regular Mira for months) some interviews have said their Signature series (the only one that can boast all of this speed and ceramic RF core) is not even on the horizon for 4 to 6 months. Last thing is price. Who in the name of all that is holy is going to pay Epilog prices for a Chinese machine? I think it is just a reverse engineered Epilog or Trotec. There was a time when I would have looked at an Aeon or Thunder, but they were just too slow for my production needs. And please, add an LCD screen! What a strange place to try to save a buck, the one thing you will touch EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU USE THE LASER!",

Id really like to get an engraver that could work well with leather for patches and also have the capability to engrave on metal like gun magazines etc. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated and feel free to send me affiliate links- thanks!",

Most of the features such as symbols, shapes, and most of the other features is tuned off. And very limited to two types of fonts.

Extra modules (like IR laser, and 20W laser switchout, + future ones), The Rotary attachment, the riser for thicker material option (which also give you the pull out crumb tray feature), the pass through capability with the riser. The Fire extinguisher module option. The conveyor system module which allows for 10 FEET material.Do all the other machines offer this? I purchased all the above (except for the 20W, which I may still buy).",

Before fully understanding the logic used to control the laser, I was surprised to see that machines with 600 to 1,000 mm speeds could only produce parts at roughly the same run time as machines with a maximum speed of 300 to 400 mm. The reason is that the faster machines have to overshoot the work area when ramping up and slowing down.\n\nUltimately, the best choice of laser comes down to (1) the purpose you intend to use it for (cutting or fine engraving) and (2) how fast it can perform the required task.",

    "comment_text": "I don’t see how any of these strategies would work at all for somebody starting in 2024. Etsy is an absolute mess of sludge from drop shippers dumping junk from Temu, Ali Express. Every social media platform blocking any promotions for Etsy stores at every step of the process up to and including shadowbanning accounts and nerfing engagement entirely. This doesn’t even account for how much AI generated images have completely swarmed other store platforms to the point that it’s hard to tell what is a real storefront or just another grift. \n\nBy all means prove me wrong, but the strategies that worked in 2017 from standstill are no longer effective today. Perhaps this video would be better suited for people who already have stores and just need a few tips, but then a few sections of this video wouldn’t be relevant to them (e.g. pricing etc)",

So what’s the deal? Are these good or are they garbage? Any input would be appreciated as spending a grand or so on any gear at the moment is a bit of an expense for me currently. I can’t afford to be throwing money away on a product that’s going to work for a week and then fail on me. So what’s the best machine for cutting/engraving leather even if it does cost like $1000-2000~ that won’t go and crap out on a guy?",

Cheers!\nSir, May I ask your opinion...\nNow that you have quite an experience with different laser machines and using them for your business, would it be wise for me to already buy the more relatively expensive machines (xtool) to start my cutting & engraving business?\n Or should I start with cheap ones and upgrade later on?\n Would this come more expensive in the long run buying these  cheap laser machine and upgrade to Xtool? \nShould I just master my skill sets with the cheaper machine and relearn the more expensive machine in the future? \nIf you were to start over, what would you do? \nI have a starting capital of $10k.\nWhat machines will you recommend? \nI'd like to learn from champagne glass engraving to large multilayer plywood art cutting like Mandala arts.\nBeing now a retiree, I have  all the time to focus and learn the trade.\nI would appreciate if you can help me decide.\nMany thanks,\nAlvin",

    "comment_text": "Xtool advertising is misleading. They say the P2 works with Lightburn (with exception of auto focus, cameras and curve feature). Given i already have a D1 and Lightburn works perfectly with it, I had no reason to assume Lightburn wouldn't work with the P2 with the exception of the explicitly stated limitations above.  I can understand not having the curve support, but all other functions should be available. Also, the XCS software is horrible. I would not expect it to be on par with LIghtburn, but there are a multitude of little things like being able to easily define layers or remove the close up view when not needed. All in all, unless you are happy to only work in XCS (assuming full support for Lightburn never comes), save your money and buy another brand CO2 (Monoport, Omtech) and get a fiber laser to go with it for what you pay for the P2. I am posting this comment not as a criticism of the this video, but in the hopes that someone watching this video in trying to decide whether to buy the P2 or not, are more fully informed. I did a fair amount of research before buying the P2 and everyone either intentionally or unknowingly failed to mention just how limited LIghtburn for P2 is nor just how bad the XCS software is.",

You went back to 1928, but let’s go further back: We saw the same trends with new technologies like electricity, the steam engine (revolutionised the weaving industry), the wheel…. Each time, we have seen new jobs emerge as a result.\n\nFor woodworkers, we can be divided into two categories: Some are production focussed, churning out the same chairs, tables, coasters every day in as high a volume as possible. For them, automation will be a God-send as they will be able to produce more a day. The other category are the more “creative” (no offence, producers) that hardly ever make two identical products. Here, machines may replace certain steps, but not the entire creative and assembly process. It’s especially the creative work that AI cannot replace - at least for many years to come.",

When the beam had penetrated a millimeter into the material, one would need to lower the focus by that millimeter, but then some \"sideways\" rays that come at angle wouldn't reach deep into the groove and will hit the material around the groove instead. Heating and possibly graying them. Is there a place where I can find explanations on that matter?",

I have worked with Camtasia in the past that would automatically zoom in at your cursor position which is even better. Camtasia is pretty expensive but I bet the cheaper options like OCB (free) will have similar functionality.",

You are getting a sub from me!\nI have been looking at getting a 3D printer, but had to put the purchase on pause due to another big purchase (an affordable house!) and then this bad boy dropped! My partner got excited and asked me if i would rather save up a little more money and then get this 2 in one, because i would like to try laser cutting but its not my main focus and the machines are rather expensive. \nSo here i am trying to research if the printer is worth it or not and from your review, which was sooo much more helpful since you know the details about laser cutting and most other reviewers are 3D printers, and i think i feel like this is a 100% the route i should go, i get to have the 3D printer i wanted but as an added bonus i can play around with the laser cutter function and it sounds like the quality and what you get is quite good even though the size is a trade off.\nBut i am also a hobbyist, i love trying my hand at many hobbies and i don't think i need a bigger surface to cut on to begin with, so honestly it really sounds like a great fit for someone like me, who needs the 3D printer but would love to try a laser cutter too :)",

Or maybe designs on their gaming consoles, or desktop gaming PC.  Etsy is full of stuff, and I wouldn't be surprised if someone already has a shop full of random offset UV printed projects.

I already own a very nice gantry CO2 laser and an open-frame (split fiber) 60W MOPA, but I've been looking for a (relatively) portable machine for doing on-site engraving.

    "comment_text": "I believe that opening the vent enables air INTO the machine which can then go to the exhaust. Without the vent opening, this sealed machine will have no way for fresh air to get into the machine at a high enough volume to not starve the filter. It’s clever, as the vent is in the front top, while the exhaust is in the middle height at the rear. So this gives you an air flow that goes right through the shortest distance, which happens to be the area where the laser is working.\n\nIf the size of the bed is ok for people and you just don’t have the room, then this is fine. The quality seems to be pretty good. As far as the different time scales for the laser or the printer, well, you just have to manage your time. If you know what you’re going to be doing, then do the short job first. These things are a compromise. If you’re willing to accept that, then it’s great. If you can’t, then this isn’t the machine for you. But don’t forget this also cuts and draws. This might be useful and it may not.",

    "comment_text": "Absolutely save the money and buy a dedicated laser printer.  The difference that you didn't mention when you compared the additional cost  of the 40W Bambu when compared to just buying the S1 is the cut size.  The camera is a nice feature, but with the alignment functions of the S1 it is minimal.  Having roughly twice the cut capacity, plus having a dedicated machine is going to completely offset the few hundred dollar difference.  Plus, XCS is a great software solution on it's own for beginners, but you can use LightBurn on the S1 when you grow beyond the limited feature set you get with Bambu Studio.\n\nAdditionally, I guarantee that the more you use the laser, the more dirty the inside of the 3D printer is going to get.  Take a picture of the inside of a P2 or P2S that gets daily use and you'll see what I mean.\n\nFinally, the problem with having a shared machine is that when the H2D eventually has a failure, you lose all of your ability to work whereas if you have different machines, you can at least still do something.",

    "comment_text": "Awkwardly, I wish they'd release the Laser edition without the laser module.  That may sound a bit odd, but the laser module is already shipped separately from the printer itself, and the Laser edition actually has other features that the non-Laser variants do not such as cutting and drawing.  Once the laser module is sold separately (I didn't find it on their store at the time of writing), then you could buy one when/if you wanted one.  They have talked about releasing an upgrade kit for the basic H2D, but given that the upgrade kit just puts you at the same level as a H2D Laser without the laser, I'd rather just buy that from the start.",

After contesting the charge on my credit card, whether that had anything to do with it or not (?), I did finally receive all ordered items.  The rotary was broken and AtomStack replaced that within a week.  With the exception of the 3rd mirror adjustment at the laser head - difficult to adjust due to the air assist tubing and the auto focusing wires disconnecting regularly (faulty connecter), oh and the decision not to provide free shipping so I'm still out $400, the machine is actually pretty good so far.  Pro: very robust metal build, this thing is solid! Proprietary software is good, I use both that and Lightburn, depending on what I am doing, and it is pretty precise.  Cons: difficult lens adjustment (laser head design could have been a bit better at little extra effort), rotary accessories are workable but made of plastic and don't have the same sturdiness of the laser (honestly, it's a beast!), but they work, just be gentle with them.  Support is decent.  I ordered during the Dragon Festival so that holiday gummed up the customer service a bit.  Expect delays in response due to  being on the other side of the world and the language barrier... some of the replies were difficult to decipher due to the language barrier.  Overall - I'm growing to really like this machine.",

For a 13x22 black text and a little color at about 71% coverage and CMYK your calculator showed a price of $0.058. That's great. When I changed the print type to White + CMYK for the same pic, it jumped to over $18..... hmmmm. That is quite the leap. The image is .png with transparency. I'm guessing your software does not see the transparency in White+CMYK mode and thinks the entire 13x22 is to be white coated. Just a guess.",

Would you be willing to make a video talking about the peos and cons of each unit, as you see them?\n\nI \"backed\" them and opted for the Ultra. I didn't just do it because \"higher number = better\" but because the Ultra has the MOPA fiber laser, and that's something I *think* I want...\n\nI mean, I like having more settings to play with and I think the colors that can be put onto stainless steel and titanium look pretty cool, both things that having MOPA enables, but I haven't used either type of fiber laser so maybe I'd change my mind if I had more information... For instance, if the colors aren't *that* great in real life, maybe the extra cost won't be as valuable to me any longer.",

They do have some parts but it's very normal for them to go out of stock for months with 0 way to backorder. Anker also abandoned their slicer software and mobile app years ago. It was left in a pretty buggy state. They have also outsourced a lot of their support to members of their discord community and have almost no official interaction with customers there. Community members have had to build custom print profiles for orca because the default profiles were extremely poor and resulted in repeated print failures. There also have been multiple reports of customers returning defective printers under warranty and being sent back a barely functional refurbished unit with major problems. I am confident this product works well and based on what I see there's nothing else on the market similarly priced. Just keep in mind anker support is awful and they do not have any loyalty to you as a customer. They will abandon you the second this product appears to be a commercial failure.",

Just place the bottom piece first to get the right spot for engraving, lift up the machine on anything steady hard wood or so on and done. figure out the right height for being able to do the cutting properly and you're set. depending on the laser only if it is still strong enough to cut out properly.

That is not including ink costs per print as well we still do not know how much ink we lose during a line flush and or the machine maintenance cycle every few hours.",

    "comment_text": "I have concerns regarding consumables the fact the machine can never be shut off without flushing the lines without knowing how much ink is lost and how many times you can flush the lines before the cleaner kit needs to be replaced. and also the machine does a cleaning cycle when not in use every few hours again not knowing ink loses and clean kit life. these are extremely expensive ink cartridges so losing ink so often to maintenance is worrisome let alone only a 3 month warranty on print heads which are extremely expensive. I was super excited and ready to jump in head first but after hearing about the ink lose and other consumables I'm struggling to see the value now, at least not without some more information on ink loss..",

Bambus new H2D 3D printer has a laser head you can add which surprised me.   I did not get it because I have an Xtools F1 and Onelaser but also why would I want all that dirt and smoke on my 3-D prints? But anyway other companies had better step up in the prosumer space because if they get serious and come out with a lidar, 5 camera, AI controlled big boy I would bet small companies will be out of business within a few years.

And the of the biggest issues are with the print head and ink.\n\n- Ink tends to dry out and clog. Any news on how thos is handled with the resin? I known it's UV resin and doesn't exactly dry out. But over time, it can still happen. Colored resin isn't just resin. There's still ink particles that can clump up when sitting idle.\n\n- The print head is easily the most annoying component. They shift and rare out over time. They're not easy nor cheap to replace. And it's not like we can just call a repair shop to come over and fix this one.\n\n- I've ran into far too many issues with the ink spilling all over the printhead and down onto the paper and internal components. How would that be addressed with this printer? Resin would be a lot more difficult to remove than traditional liquid or powder ink.\n\n- To add to that, how easy is it to repair/place the print bed components? The belt, the gears, etc?",

Meaning, you must constantly be banging out prints or you eat up cleaning cartridges for simply sitting idle. I'm on edge about buying this machine because everyone talking good about it got it for free sponsored, and isn't exactly giving a truly bias opinion. Eufymake also dumped on their customers in the past launching products then killing support and dropping the product line all together. The only hope I have is that adam savage from tested used this so I'd hope it would mean it would be continuously used. If the self cleaning cartridges were cheap then not much of an issue. If some other china company sells cheaper inks, great, many headaches cost wise solved.",

I imagine this would be extremely popular and enormously make a viral hit with a much larger consumer base. Imagine instant accurate 3d image capture that we already own translated into a 3d print with perfect color. I wouldn't be on the fence of backing the kickstarter if this already exists or had a real potential for being a thing.",

Any recommendations on which one I should get?

I am very new to the field, watching your videos and motivated to get my feet wet and start working hard! I appreciate any advice you can give me. Thank you.",

You can buy UV ink in 1kg bottles if you own a regular UV printer... the inks expire quite fast, and you have to constantly clean/cycle the printer. If you think your dead inkjet printheads were bad, UV is infinitely worse and requires a lot of maintenance. I can definitely see people with dried up print heads if they just do this for fun once in a while. \n\nThat said, this is a really interesting and unique take on a UV printer but just the ink cartridges is an instant no for me. Bad to say, but I really hope someone else takes this idea and makes a ink tank version that works with regular UV ink on the market. lol.",

There is no way for them to know how much the tariffs will affect the final price. The importer on record for the parcel is the one paying the tariffs unless the exporter precollects it and then pays customs. So it could mean that Eufy pays the tariff or it could mean that Eufy is not collecting the tariff, and it's your problem when it arrives.",

    "comment_text": "🙋‍♂️ Warranty’s don’t cover everything. This machine has proprietary parts like a Glowforge, so when it breaks, you’ll likely have to pay to ship it to China for repairs, covering shipping and tariffs both ways, which could get pricey fast. The ink is already overpriced at $299 for 600ml, and with tariffs, it jumps to $477 to ship to you—that’s $12.50–$23.50 for just 100 small prints, compared to the 3060UV-V2’s $0.13 (one of many uv desktops) eufyMake’s lack of transparency on ink usage and support is a red flag, and they’ve already abandoned their 3D printer backers in the past, leaving them with nothing. They’re promising free shipping on 6,437 units, but that’s $7.9 million in shipping and tariffs they might not handle. If they do, this risks delays or hidden fees. You’ll also have to raise your prices much higher than expected to recoup costs on this toss-away machine. Also, could you please provide precise ml/print data for different print types (e.g., small prints, 3D textures, A4 prints) to help us calculate true costs Also, are there plans to ship from the United States for us to avoid tariffs? Or is this printer going to collect dust from customers that can’t afford the now higher cost for the ink?",

Where the cost is $22 in ink, and 7 hours to print. And when so many people buy these UV printers, the market will be flooded with people selling raised prints. The tumbler and mug markets are already saturated with sublimated items. The flat metal market, and sticker market the same. With heat transfers, sublimation, vinyl, direct to film (dtf), white toner laser, and other uv printers, the market is saturated with sellers using these technologies. This printer looks so cool, but that's also its problem ... when tons of people buy them, the market will be oversupplied with sellers. That's not a market I want in on. Etsy and eBay will be flooded with AI, raised/textured prints within days. And it will be a race to the bottom.\nI have been turned off by so many other youtube channels that seem to be just shills for this printer.\nThank you for pointing out some of the cons, and holding off your review until you get a production unit.",

    "comment_text": "I pre-ordered a OneLaser XRF in December and lots of people complained about how long it took to get it. At that time they were a start-up company just finishing the final design phase and told me I’d have my unit in late March or early April. I got it the last week of April.  The shipper called me and said it would be here Tuesday and they would call 30 minutes out.  Well, my wife was home all day because she is a kept woman 😜but they never called and just dropped it in the driveway… My wife called and said your laser is here but I can’t move it! lol So delivery is not the best. It sat in my driveway until I got home. Just know, no porch pirate is going to snatch it off your property.  It weighs 179 pounds! This is not your parents’ xTool  Laser!! It is a quality built Professional engraver. I am using the included exhaust system and it works pretty good. But I may upgrade it in the future. My xTool D1 20 is a great machine but it did not come with an enclosure or vent system. Is it fast? Yes. Yes! Can you get a darker image than he did? Yes. If you are just a hobbyist I would stick with the xTool brand. They are the best bang for the buck. But if you are a semi-pro or are looking for a side gig this machine is a no brainer. Just make sure your cousin Eddie is around to help you get it up on your work bench because my little 5 foot wife was useless when it came to that!",

    "comment_text": "Nah... most of us that are deep into printing, know that there's only a handful of chemical ink producers, and it's no longer the 90s, and basically everyone follows very similar formulas and pigment densities. UV ink is only special in it's resin binder that's activated by very specific wavelength of UV light. The most common is 395um. But even still many commercial UV inks will cure within a range of 385um to 405um.\n\nThat being said... if I bought this printer, the first thing I would do is learn the cartridge system, and see if they are chip coding them or not. And secondly, if there was a way to non-destructively refill them. BECAUSE, even really good 3rd party UV ink should only cost you between $15-20 per liter. There might be some variance on the white, it's particle size and what specific inkjet heads they are using. Again, this is a start-up, so I promise you they aren't designing their own piezo electric print heads from scratch. They are sourcing them from Ricoh or Epson. If you know which one, you can buy inks specifically tailored to that particular print head. It's not that complicated.\n\nRemember, ALL printer companies make their business model around you, the customer always buying ink from them, keeping them in business.",

    "comment_text": "Thanks for the review and updates. Super fast response to questions! Awesome.\nSubscription software for functionality (credits...) is where I might have to think twice... At the forefront is \"3D relief\" or \"depth printing\" and that, from your brief answer, seems to be tied to a subscription that gives credits. Free tier has limited use, but based on their \"you can make this much per day printing with this machine\" the cost in credits should be calculated into this. \n\nRegardless, great product, wonderful price for entry. A bit shady in not being upfront and clear as to how much total running costs will be. I'd hoped companies would take note after the BambuLab \"this is how we will operate going forward\" backlash but looks like more *asterisk* stuff could be on the radar. \n\nThanks for the updates again. See if you can get more information on the subscription tiers/specifics. If it's anything like Adobe (which I love, but costs a bit) then this is something to definitely factor into the cost of printing products as well as the ink.\n\nImagine a tradeshow/event with a line of 20+ clients and you run out of \"credits\" for generation...ChatGPT like tiers? Free - $20 - $200?....scary...",

Otherwise after one week, when the novelty runs out, people will place their machines to sleep. But if the percived price is afordable, people will exepriment and move on. After 1 year the company could re-evaluate the price of paint. Even if they increase the price over one year will be less damaging to the company, since people will already have hfound their niche and be able to properly evaluate continuity. Just my 2 cents.",

The key is, this is not a regular home printer, this is a professional UV Printer.

I already have a UV Printer, a Roland flatbed, here is an example of what I charge for a name tags. We just completed an order of 90 name tags and we charge $10 each, out cost per name tag was around $1.50, we ganged the name tags on our flatbed.

    "comment_text": "Established companies like Anker, the owner of Eufy, should not be using Kickstarter as a funding platform. These corporations have ample financial resources to support their own projects, yet they turn to crowdfunding as a way to shift all risk onto consumers and backers. If their product fails—like their previous 3D printers—these companies remain unaffected, profiting from sold units while losing nothing on research and development.\nWhat makes this situation particularly concerning is that working units of the product already exist, as multiple YouTubers have demonstrated in their reviews. So what, exactly, is being “Kickstarted”? The manufacturing process? This is not what Kickstarter was originally intended for. Unfortunately, more and more established and profitable companies continue to exploit the platform, using it as a shield to protect their investments rather than a genuine tool for innovation.\nThis unethical practice places all financial risk on backers, who are left vulnerable if the product fails. Meanwhile, content creators often enable this cycle by eagerly accepting free units and promoting them without scrutiny. If influencers refused to provide exposure to these companies without genuine accountability, failed launches could force corporations to rethink their approach and adhere to proper business practices.",

I definitely would be interested to see how your cups hold up in the dishwasher too though. Thanks!",

    "comment_text": "I put down my deposit so now I'm just waiting for the Kick to start.  I have a few questions, I'm hoping you can answer.  1) How long do the resin cartridges last, ie: how much can you print?  I know that is somewhat subjective, based on what you print, and how much of each color you use, but take your Mando print on wood.  How much resin did that take?  How many of those could you print with a single kit?  2) Since the printer has to lay down a white layer under anything that isn't being printed on a white surface, is the white tank bigger than the colors?  I think I saw somewhere that the ink kit would be around $300 to replace, and if you're going through that (and/or a cleaning kit) every few months, that has a pretty high cost of usage.  3) I saw another video about printing on tumblers and cups and it seemed to suggest that the machine was pretty picky about the sizes and shapes of tumblers it works with.  The ones you demo'd appear to be Eufy branded, so not just any old tumbler.  It loses a lot of flexibility if you can only print on their materials.  4) The sticker lamination set up looks like it might require some kind of transfer material, and I'm wondering if that is also proprietary.  I live in Alaska, so I'm really cautious about new tech with proprietary media / materials, because all too often companies don't ship to Alaska or treat it like a completely foreign country.  ($200 to ship a $99 thing - Xtool won't even ship replacement lenses or mirrors to Alaska).  Thanks in advance.",

It's not like it's even really making a new image, you're literally feeding it the image you're copying, call it inspiration all you like, but it's just plagiarism with the extra step of telling the computer to do it for you. And frankly, why bother with chatGPT if you're just gonna plagiarize things, you can already do that for free.\n\nAs for selling your photos with generated images of your product, I would say that's just false advertising. If you're portraying something as a photo of the product, and it's not a photo of the product, you're just lying, again, with extra steps. And sure, if you want to sell your product by lying, that's hardly a new idea - just ask El Nasir - but let's at least be honest with ourselves about what we're doing here.\n\nLook, man, I'm not entirely against AI being used as a tool. There are even ethically trained AI models out there(even if ChatGPT isn't one of them). But this this isn't helping folks, it's the opposite. It's just a way to have people offload essential - and fairly easy to learn, in my experience - skills for a creative business to a tool they don't control, and ensuring they are turbo-screwed when those tools change or go away, as well as essentially telling people to do sketchy and in some given examples downright unethical things like it's normal and fine.\n\nIf you want an example, let's say, hey, someone spun up a business doing portraits of people in Ghibli style using chatGPT...they'd have some angry customers right about now, because in the time between filming and this video being made, ChatGPT has taken that feature offline, with no indication of when it will return. Which is especially ironic, considering Brandon's quite reasonable complaints with hardware about not having it in your control, and a third party being able to shut you down arbitrarily, at any time, with no recourse.\n\nAnd no, I don't expect this comment to last too long, a few hours at most, whenever Brandon's part of the US wakes up. But that's fair enough, I've said my piece, so no skin off my nose.",

Now I can finally make these parts without using those crappy regular subtractive manufacturing techniques that leave 90deg cuts, so inconvenient!",

I personally have a couple thousand pieces to engrave, and I was thinking I could provide engraving as a service to other technicians to help pay for the machine (who also have lots of tools) and I would also provide personalized enamel filling. What wattage would be best for chrome vanadium, speed isn’t critical, and engraving points will tend to be small (~25mm^2 or less)? I also wanted to know what kind of surface treatment I may need when working with reflective chrome plated tools.\n\nAny and all help would be awesome!",

What video settings (resolution and frame rate) did you use with your Insta, and how big (mAh) was the external battery you used for the power supply? The Insta X2 gets relatively warm when recording, and I hope that this won't be a problem at high altitudes when the heat can only be dissipated via radiation.",

    "comment_text": "Laser diodes are currently limited to about 5W of output power under ideal conditions, which means that any diode laser with a higher power will have multiple diodes. This introduces a problem in that it is very difficult to get all the beams lined up, so the beam is often not very well focused. You will note that I said OUTPUT power. The problem with a lot of diode lasers you might find on Aliexpress or Ebay is that the seller is listing the INPUT electrical power, which is usually about 4 to 5 times the output power. Yep, most of the input power gets turned into heat. \n\nA diode laser with a genuine 40W output will consume a least 160W, and will be turning about 120W of the input power into heat. That's if you actually have a 160W power supply for it. If it doesn't have a massive heatsink, it probably isn't a 40W laser.\n\nSo you need to be careful when buying a diode laser, particularly a cheap one from China. Your 40W diode laser is probably only giving you 5W or 10W of actual output power.",

I then got the refurbished unit, and the power stopped after just over one year. It would cost over $1000 to fix it. I’m looking for something, hopefully more dependable. I’m always afraid to take on a big job because what if it breaks down while doing it? All that said, what are your thoughts on the OneLaser’s dependability?",

I have my printers working in the same room that I am spending the day and it is not too bad regarding the fumes that 3D printers are generating. So can someone let me know how bad the fumes are for laser engraving and cutting wooden materials? I would consider the air purifier, but while reviewing those, it seemed that they are very loud and I could not work in the same room while the air purifier is working. And I can't really keep the window open all the time to get the fumes out constantly. So my question is - are the fumes from laser cutting and engraving worse than from the 3D printing? Or would it be fine if I opened the window for couple of minutes every few hours? I am currently looking at the Creality Falcon 2.",

Do I just adjust the laser to be thinner or is there something I can do to counter this? I would like my inlays to look 100% Smooth and with no gaps. Please let me know what you think. Thanks",

Based on quotes for machines of the same size (1300mm), the OneLaser is about 24% more expensive than the Pronto, claims to be 20% faster, and offers the option of an RF laser. To my knowledge, neither machine uses servo motors like the Thunder Laser. It’s a very capable machine and may have better support than some competitors. However, it’s a new brand with no established track record, although it appears to be closely associated with Thunder Laser, which has a solid reputation. Definitely tempting.",

    "comment_text": "I’m really considering this one—the price is amazing for something that’s on par with Trotec or Epilog. Even with shipping, it’s still super competitive compared to most professional lasers out there. What’s even better is that they’re planning to roll out extra features and lifetime upgrade options, which could turn this into the ultimate cabinet CO2 laser. It’s definitely shaping up to be a solid choice.\n\nOn the flip side, I’ve never used thunder machine but I had some experience with the OMTECH Pro series, and honestly, omtech services sucks, the speed didn’t match the advertised claims, and the bed would occasionally tilt, causing alignment issues and other issues here and there.—so I’m glad Onelaser stepping it up with a better game.\n\nWhat I really like about OneLaser is their U.S.-based team. They’re super responsive and actually take the time to answer questions properly, which you don’t see often. The only drawback? You’ve got to wait 2-3 months for inventory, but they’ve promised stock is on the way. Hopefully, they deliver on that soon!",

From what' I've seen:\n\nFusion360 is great for design, but the cost/license might be a deal-breaker for many \nParametric (i.e. ability to undo as many steps as you want) is a must-have feature\nFreeCAD might be a bit difficult for the beginner\nOnShape supports exporting without having the $2500/year license\nPro/Corporate Users should stick with Siemens Solid Edge , Solidworks, Catia, Pro-Engineer\nThen there's other that don't have nearly as much users.. Moi3D, OctoPrint, etc.\n\nbut for most beginners, it seems TinkerCad and Plasticity are the solid choices?\n\nBTW, do you recommend any low-cost 3d printer service?  Sculpteo , Shapeways, CraftCloud, xometry, protolabs?  How about for CNC / Laser ?",
