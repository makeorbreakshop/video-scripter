I use a boss co2 laser at school where i teach, but this is for me personally. \n\nWould i need to get an air assist? Is that needed, or does the small fan in the laser do enough? 10w would be good enough to small cutting? I don't mind taking a few passes. \n\nAnd the boss laser has an air fan in there, would this just be ok next to an open window and an exhaust fan? I'm thinking about fumes or smoke. \n\nThanks for your great channel!",

    "comment_text": "Another great video, thank you. I think this is going to be a great machine. I think Xtool appeals to more people because of the ease of use/software and their 3d mapping for curved surfaces. A little learning curve with Lightburn but being new to engraving, its not that bad IMO. Watch a few videos and you are good to go.\n\nI am curious about the noise of the base unit laser one. How loud is it in decibels? How loud when you add in the air assist? Also what type of maintenance is needed for the laser one (weekly, monthly? your recommendations). Also a quick run down for new people like me on what materials you can use with it would have been nice (but I can check the website for that). \n\nI'm looking at getting a laser this Jan or Feb. Considered Roly Lasermatic (larger version) and Xtool but this looks really nice. Will definitely put this on my list as a product to watch.",

Lazer consistency is off sometimes..  speed is at 1900 and power is at 80% ..   Does not always happen.. but just curious what in the world could be going on.. the depth of the engraving is just not consistent ...Air assist is off and over scanning at 2.5%.. could this be something in the \"Common settings\" Maybe the scan angle? the image is in 3 layers..but the setting are the same in all layers..   The layers starts good but then changes occur and you see deeper areas then the rest on that particular layer... Even when i join the entire file as one layer after i group it together..  I aways burn the same image, just change the text in it.. anyone here have any thoughts? thanx.",

I use the laser to fabricate wooden mechanisms using solid hardwoods; typically 1/4 in thick but have used 3/8 and 1/2 inch material (Maple,Oak,Cherry,Walnut). Can this XRF One Laser be used for this type of work? Are there other lenses available to help with the thicker materials? Thanks",

Looking forward to the actual performance of the OneLaser XRT, they advertise 3D Photerealistic accuracy and would like to some before pushing the button.  I was looking at CO2 lasers upgrading from a 10W diode to expand capabilities, big step. I like the fact that the RF, though more expensive, doesn't require the additional cooling requirement in comparing to the CO2 machines.  You mentioned the 3-2-1 warranty, does that mean should the fan on the RF tube or tube itself faults that there is a 3yr warranty on it?  Thanks again for all the great videos and reviews.",

    "comment_text": "Great reviews, and thanks for the details !  I’m totally on board with this ranking. \n\nI had a Polar before—it worked fine at first, but quickly turned into a disaster. The inside of the machine? Constantly filthy. You have to clean the lens every couple of hours to keep it from getting scorched, and the build quality is… let’s just say, not great. I’ve spent so much time on fixing shit, dat I could’ve paid for a whole new machine by now. And customer service? Practically nonexistent. They pass you around, and might call back two weeks later, right after you’ve DIY-fixed the issues.\n\nThe P2S was my top pick—not just for the minor upgrades, but mostly for the bed size (23.6” x 12”) and speed. And let’s be real—their ads are literally everywhere. You can’t escape them! This company must have piles of cash to burn; it’s insane how much they’re pouring into marketing. There are other niche brands like Bolt and Mira, but their bed sizes are too small for my needs, and the pricing is all over the place. Then I saw the ONELASER X, launching right after the P2S, and this new brand checked all my boxes: a bigger bed size (26” x 14”), excellent build quality, twice the speed, a clean cabinet design with an enclosed base, and full US-based support., Honestly, I was nervous about going with a new brand, but now I’m convinced I made the right choice.\n\nHopefully, OneLaser ships my order on time—because that’s the important part they can’t afford to mess up! I mean that seriously.",

    "comment_text": "After watching the product video, I feel confident in this purchase. I really appreciated the clear, up-close views and detailed breakdown, especially around items to consider ordering to be prepared for the machine’s arrival. I'm glad you suggested getting the air assist, setting up proper ventilation, and preparing for fume management. Thanks for the excellent insights—I’m looking forward to working with this machine!\n\nOne of the most innovative features, and something I find especially valuable, is the built-in air quality indicator. This sensor is a game changer, allowing real-time air quality monitoring, which is particularly helpful in a closed room with only a window for ventilation. I had been considering purchasing a separate air quality sensor, so having this integrated feature is a fantastic benefit. Given that a lot of our work can produce strong odors, seeing an indicator for particle levels is very helpful for health and safety.",

GF also has a status light, though I'm not sure if it's as function rich.\nQuestions:\nA) Why is it that the mirrors on GF never need calibration? I don't know if it's even possible. \nB) How does GF stay cool with never having to change any liquids? \n\nThanks for your videos. Very good!",
