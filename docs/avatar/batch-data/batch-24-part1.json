The Carvera has 'free' shipping on their website so the later price of the air may come with that also.",

There were a lot of ways to contact them to have them get back to you, but no way to actually find out the price without them having your contact info and being able to possibly spam you with sales calls. Maybe I'm the only one, but that makes this a non-starter for me. I used to teach laser cutting at a maker space on a $75,000 laser cutter (I did not own it), so I know they can get up there, and I'm sure this one is no where near that. But, I'm not going to jump through hoops to find out.\n\nSome people will say, \"Well, if you have to ask, you can't afford it.\" Except that if you are a small shop, and have a budget, it is actually possible that you could afford it, and you would like to know so you can set aside the money,.......   \n\nIt's more like, \"If your potential customer has to ask, then you probably shouldn't be hiding it.\"",

    "comment_text": "Thank you for tackling what could be a thorny subject. Personally I always love to listen to reviewers' takes on the machines and I usually form some opinion using an aggregate of reviews. And even this only forms part of my overall opinion. Reviews are great but they never take the place of doing your own hard research. And you have to accept that MOST of these lasers are built in part or in whole in China where the quality is not always consistent. So no matter what you do you may end up with a bad sample of an otherwise good laser. I am much more concerned about the company I am buying from and their customer service than the actual laser itself 99% of the time.\n\nBut that being said I do thing the reviews have value as long as nobody doing them tries to hide the fact that they received the laser for free for review. Honesty and openness are the requirement for these reviews to have any merit. You have never given me any reason to think you are otherwise so I love following your channel.",

    "comment_text": "I watch you regularly, and expected that your knowledge level would be a bit higher. First, she talks about the speed. Owning an Epilog Fusion Pro, I know something about speed. At top speed and max output power, you are hardly leaving a mark on wood. So, the speed argument is a little dumb. The accordions on the side of the gantry to protect the internals of the machine is something Epilog has had for years. The idea that somehow, the autofocus built-in to the lens carriage is something new is also wrong. Epilog, Trotec, and honestly several others I can think of have been doing that for years. Servo motors? Welcome to 2020. Let's talk resolution. 1000 DPI, is nowhere near class-leading. She talks about how happy she is about how rigid they are, being built of steel. Why did they add several hundred pounds to the machine by cheapening out with steel when they should have gone with military grade aluminum. I notice that my Epilog is under 300 pounds while the Aeon with the same bed size is 550 pounds. Some of them go up to 1,500 pounds. She talks about being able to change frequency, well I am not certain, but I think several companies have had that for years. I know I can change that on mine. The drop-in water cooled tube that doesn't change alignment is cool, bravo on that point! Even if you could buy one, (many people can not get a regular Mira for months) some interviews have said their Signature series (the only one that can boast all of this speed and ceramic RF core) is not even on the horizon for 4 to 6 months. Last thing is price. Who in the name of all that is holy is going to pay Epilog prices for a Chinese machine? I think it is just a reverse engineered Epilog or Trotec. There was a time when I would have looked at an Aeon or Thunder, but they were just too slow for my production needs. And please, add an LCD screen! What a strange place to try to save a buck, the one thing you will touch EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU USE THE LASER!",

I have a clothing brand which offers soft goods, hats and military patches etc. I’ve been outsourcing leather patches but I want to start to purchase what it takes to cut the middle men out. Id really like to get an engraver that could work well with leather for patches and also have the capability to engrave on metal like gun magazines etc. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated and feel free to send me affiliate links- thanks!",

Yes you can leave a bit, and do other things but those hundreds of hours of machine time, you still need to be in the shop. More just pointing out the time calculation gets complicated. So woodworkers do this math a little bit different, total time divided by total profit(minus materials) is your hourly rate of pay",

So i just got on the easter sale, i do think there is a big gap between just the base machine and what they are actually selling. Like the riser base was tossed on with everything. But going with max config and having thr conveyer adds a whole lot more working area than others.",

Most of the features such as symbols, shapes, and most of the other features is tuned off. And very limited to two types of fonts. This company “Glowforge “ is the most expensive laser cutter out there in terms of their software. Plus, you can’t use any other software with the Glowforge Aura or Spark models.

The full enclosure did sell me the most, but the extra features really made this purchase a no brainer. I find it odd that you didn't mention that the S1 has all the attachments. Extra modules (like IR laser, and 20W laser switchout, + future ones), The Rotary attachment, the riser for thicker material option (which also give you the pull out crumb tray feature), the pass through capability with the riser. The Fire extinguisher module option. The conveyor system module which allows for 10 FEET material.Do all the other machines offer this? I purchased all the above (except for the 20W, which I may still buy).",
