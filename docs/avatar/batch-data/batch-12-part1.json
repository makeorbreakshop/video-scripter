Quite scary ordering from China because of the stories of it being held up at customs or people have also said theirs came damaged. But they did rectify the decision with those people.

I want to cut thin wood & use rotary, though. So I was forced to by d1 pro 10w since 20w is way too expensive right now. Speed trade off, right? If lc-40 had 10 or 20w, I definitely would have bought that. If I was ONLY engraving, it would be the best laser for that, hands down. Build is just that much better. Linear rails, no brainer.",
