All the reviews i have seen keep showing a window with pre set calculations as a guide to show you what the settings should be for different materials...mine does not have any such window!  The hardware looks good but it can only excel if its software is well thought out...THIS ISN'T. it is very frustrating and to cap it all i have just tried to leave a product review on Amazon but strangely Amazon keep telling me they can't find the product i purchased new just one week ago?.. all my other purchases are still there waiting to be reviewed .I I wonder if they are getting a lot of returns.",

One of my friends was recommending I look at diode lasers.  However these are really bad a cutting aluminium and carbon fiber is really hard.  I've seen the fiber lasers are much better for aluminium.  There is also some evidence from youtube the fiber lasers can also now cut carbon fibre.  However, I can't find many reviews using the fiber lasers to cut carbon fibre.  In short, I'm wondering if only a MOPA fiber laser can cut carbon fiber?  If you could let me know your thoughts that could make a big difference to me.  Looks like the 'Max' fiber lasers are also best avoided!",

For the adaptive clearance cnc bit - one obviously needs to probe Z top height and X & Y outer corners (based on the stock corner chosen or box point); but for the parallel path the cnc bit is changed to a bullnose - and while one does need to probe again Z tool height again, do we also need to probe the outer corners X & Y again? .....It can get a little confusing when you consider that the silhouette cut for the adaptive clearance bit is set to \"tool outside boundary\", while the parallel path bullnose bit chosen is set to \"tool centre on boundary\". Does fusion just do the calculation for you when you go from one bit to the next \"for the x & y box point\", or does one have to probe X & Y again (in addition to Z) for each cnc bit change?",

    "comment_text": "I would never go the Glowforge route for the same reason that I have never and will never go for iPhone over Samsung or Mac over PC. Apple are monopolists. That is to say, if you buy an Apple product you are buying into a closed ecosystem that does not allow for competition, meaning that whatever you need beyond the basic product itself, i.e., accessories, software, etc., can only be purchased from Apple at whatever price Apple dictates, take it or leave it.\n\nGlowforge have obviously decided to emulate the Apple everything-in-house business model and for me their online-only obligatory subscription software model that excludes all other possibilities is a deal breaker, and that's before taking into account the fact that the product costs twice as much as the Gwieke. If I buy something, I own it _not_ it owns me.",

    "comment_text": "Oh yea, I used to work for a company that did precision laser cutting, drilling, skiving, micro-vias and occasionally engraving. We had machines in the hundreds of thousands of dollars range, even a few into a million dollar range. ESI was a brand, from China I believe, that we had that did UV lasers. Another was the Excellon Cobra which had both UV and CO2 in 1 machine so you could cut/skive/drill with one and do a finish pass with the other. Or a multilayer panel with different materials like copper and dielectric. Cool stuff. Have been thinking about getting a laser engraver for some product ideas I have",
