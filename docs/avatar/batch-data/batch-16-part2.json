Obviously we're comparing new to used and there are some software features the used Epilog won't have (camera).  But overall, I don't get why anyone would buy this when you can get a much better machine at the same price.",

Its for my classroom so needs to fit as a desktop unit and I was lookign at the p2 or the flux hexa\n\nMy main interest is getting a machine that can cut ~1/8 mdf faster and it is hard to get a comparison of cutting speeds (we do alot of layered designs). I was hoping the p2 or flux hexa or other desktop style co2 lasers would be significantly faster than the glowforge pro if anyone can point to evidence for that I would appreciate, thank you.",

    "comment_text": "You left out a couple of hugely important categories... 1.  \"Can you buy parts?\"  \n\nAt least one of those machines will not sell you parts, when your tube gets weak you have to ship it back to the manufacturer and they give you a coupon for a discount on a supposed \"Refurbished\" machine.   So to replace your tube cost you a few thousand dollars, or a bearing, or any other part you can't get from somewhere else.\n\n2. One thing I that wasn't clear in the \"Connectivity\" section, which machines force you to be connected to their cloud before they let you use it?  That is a HUGE deal breaker for me.  If the internet, or your router, or their server, is down so is your laser???  Not going to happen.  \n\nIf a company has that much control over whether or not you can use your machine that will eventually come around to screw you, guaranteed.  At some point that company is going to want you to pay for it's cloud, meaning a new monthly subscription service.  At any time that company could go out of business making your laser a super expensive paper weight.  Look at how many Youtube vids are out there highlighting how their projects were delayed, or completely ruined because Adobe's servers crashed so Premier locked up.  \n\nBoth of these issues make a huge difference in which lasers are usable/affordable.",

    "comment_text": "I was glad to see that you gave Glowforge a 1 star for software, but you didn't really say why.  The reason is because glowforge does not run gcode, it does not and cannot accept gcode, so it's impossible for any software to interface with it.  Everything has to go through their website.  Also you have to pay a monthly fee to do anything but the very basics with their software.  If you want to cut a square, for example, through their software, that is considered a premium feature and you have to pay for that feature.\n\nBut glowforge does do passthrough nicely.\nAlso glowforge has some nice features that you've missed.  For example it detects if you cut anything that will create poison gas that will kill you.  An absolute must if you're going to put this in a classroom where a kid might be vinyl in the machine. That feature alone would make the glowforge the only option for many IMHO.",

If you think you are going to laser some cool images on a piece of wood and ever get your money back...think again.  Every Tom, Dick, and Harry is out there trying to do the same exact thing.  The cheaper the entry level into business (and 5K is beyond cheap) the more people are going to be in your space and for that reason...you should really have an idea of how you are going to make a profit BEFORE you buy the laser.  This is way more important than the price differences between the laser.  You can come back from spending to much if you have a great idea.  You will not come back from getting a great deal on a laser if you have no idea how you are going to turn a profit.  Figure it out before you buy the laser....don't hope and pray you will just magically figure it all out after you get it.",

You can just make a plywood box with a hinged lid. You seal it with caulk in the seams and weather stripping on the lid. And for air flow you put a PC fan on the side and a hose coming out the other side you vent to a window. To see you can add some plexiglass to the lid and/or sides. It may not look pretty but it works really well and is cheap.",

    "comment_text": "Im hoping you can help me make a huge decisions!   Im looking at starting a small business doing mainly photo engravings and cutting maybe at max ½\" thick wood. Im used to working a Glowforge Pro and im nervous about a steep learning curve with other printers. \nWith that said im really close to pulling the trigger on an Xtool P2 but I discovered the Thunder Laser USA Thunderbolt RF co2 laser and now I'm really torn between the two machines.  I really like that the Xtool looks a lot easier to use than the Thunder Laser and isnt as tall but i want the best machine i can get for what i need.  Quality is super important but i need to be able to use the software too.  \n\nIm really torn as this is a huge investment.  \n\nCurrently i use ImagR to process all of my photos to engrave and import them. \n\nCan you offer your insight? Thanks in advance!",
