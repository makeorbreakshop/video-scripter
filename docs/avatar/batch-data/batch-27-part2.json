Those who back the Kickstarter will get an \"extra\" White ink, but this is only a one-time stretch goal, NOT something the printer normally comes with.",

    "comment_text": "Thanks for the review and updates. Super fast response to questions! Awesome.\nSubscription software for functionality (credits...) is where I might have to think twice... At the forefront is \"3D relief\" or \"depth printing\" and that, from your brief answer, seems to be tied to a subscription that gives credits. Free tier has limited use, but based on their \"you can make this much per day printing with this machine\" the cost in credits should be calculated into this. \n\nRegardless, great product, wonderful price for entry. A bit shady in not being upfront and clear as to how much total running costs will be. I'd hoped companies would take note after the BambuLab \"this is how we will operate going forward\" backlash but looks like more *asterisk* stuff could be on the radar. \n\nThanks for the updates again. See if you can get more information on the subscription tiers/specifics. If it's anything like Adobe (which I love, but costs a bit) then this is something to definitely factor into the cost of printing products as well as the ink.\n\nImagine a tradeshow/event with a line of 20+ clients and you run out of \"credits\" for generation...ChatGPT like tiers? Free - $20 - $200?....scary...",

    "comment_text": "Finally some that made a video about this. Remember that 3rd party inks can also cause clogging your print heads and might void your warranty. The key is, this is not a regular home printer, this is a professional UV Printer. The price that you should be charging your customers should be 3x or or higher depending on what you are printing and the method. I already have a UV Printer, a Roland flatbed, here is an example of what I charge for a name tags. We just completed an order of 90 name tags and we charge $10 each, out cost per name tag was around $1.50, we ganged the name tags on our flatbed. So a few jobs can definitely pay of this machine, just don't under sell your time and products.",

    "comment_text": "Established companies like Anker, the owner of Eufy, should not be using Kickstarter as a funding platform. These corporations have ample financial resources to support their own projects, yet they turn to crowdfunding as a way to shift all risk onto consumers and backers. If their product fails—like their previous 3D printers—these companies remain unaffected, profiting from sold units while losing nothing on research and development.\nWhat makes this situation particularly concerning is that working units of the product already exist, as multiple YouTubers have demonstrated in their reviews. So what, exactly, is being “Kickstarted”? The manufacturing process? This is not what Kickstarter was originally intended for. Unfortunately, more and more established and profitable companies continue to exploit the platform, using it as a shield to protect their investments rather than a genuine tool for innovation.\nThis unethical practice places all financial risk on backers, who are left vulnerable if the product fails. Meanwhile, content creators often enable this cycle by eagerly accepting free units and promoting them without scrutiny. If influencers refused to provide exposure to these companies without genuine accountability, failed launches could force corporations to rethink their approach and adhere to proper business practices.",
