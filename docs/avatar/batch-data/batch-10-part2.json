It is wee bit cheaper than Gweike, should come with air assist (though no additional info to this) and autofocus. I am interested if it is gonna be a worthy competitor to Gweike, an exact copy, or if they even managed to make it worse than Gweike. They named it Polar.",

They can help against slippage while gluing, maybe even make the joints marginally stronger, but you don't actually need them.\n2:20 this is actually nonsense. If you alternate the directions you're going to get a wavy surface. You're averaging out the warping, but not stopping the warping. If you keep them all in one direction and make sure it wants to bow in an upward arch, if you then fasten the middle securely the entire rail the top rests on will stop it from warping altogether (that is, unless there's so much force the fastening doesn't hold, but you shouldn't get such moisture extremes indoors).\n40:20 you did the breadboard wrong. In the board itself you can just drill holes, but the part it slides over can only have a normal drill hole in the middle (to keep the breadboard centered). The other holes need to be elongated slots rather than just holes, so the pins going through them have room to move sideways (but not length wise obviously). Just a few millimeters, but what you've done now is basically the same as screwing the board on. This creates stress. Also, there's no need to glue it in the middle. You can, but you should glue less wide than you did. Just a bit around the centre pin.\n 4:20 yup, you need to practice planing. Especially sharpening your plane. Make it sharp, slightly round the corners, use a shallow setting, work methodically, and you won't have marks. Also, you need to check whether the sole of your plane is flat. \n\nGood on you for keeping practicing and wanting to learn!",

But once you find the height, measure it with calipers.  Then make a block that height--in my case, I 3D printed a simple rectangular block, was able to get within 0.05mm of the desired height, I think.  Then, if you want to etch, place your block on top of the etching surface, and let the laser module rest on the block while tightening.  If you want to burn, set your block on the empty honeycomb (or whatever sacrificial surface), and let the module rest on the block while tightening--remove the block and insert your material to burn.  This puts the focal length at the bottom of the material.  Note, this only works for up to a few millimeters of material.",

The only problem is it's really hard to follow because it goes so fast, but I found changing the playback speed to .75 solves that problem. This video has really helped me understand how the software works. Great job, and thanks for sharing your knowledge. Your videos on laser cutters are awesome too!",

    "text": "First, great video! Great presentation style, nice and concise, good info delivered well. One thing I would have loved to have heard from you is what the main differences between a diode-based machine and a co2-based machine. I know you touched on diodes are more ‚Äúbeginner/budget‚Äù, and more compact and portable, but what are the pros and cons of each? Who‚Äôs the audience for each platform? And why would a diode be a better fit for this type of person, be a co2? And visa versa? I get that typically a co2 machine has a bigger work area, but I can‚Äôt image that‚Äôs the only benefit of going the co2-based route. Thoughts?",

The Chinese machines have part replacement issues and the water cooled are a real clumsy system that takes up space. Real pro machines, the kind that will last if you are trying to make money, are well over $12,000 dollars. Diode lasers required a LOT of patience and lots of scrap material to get the engraving where you want it on the work piece.  The video is spot on but lacks in total coverage of lasers that are out there.",

    "text": "You are having problems with aluminium because you are not using the correct type of end mill. If the mill is chocking up use an end mill with more flutes or a higher rotation speed. Also you need mills with cutting geometry specifically for soft metals like aluminium and brass on low powered machines like this. If you had tried this with brass it would have probably given even worse results because brass is so soft it tends to grab the cutter so definitely needs correct end mills with the correct geometry. Also a shorter end mill will help and repositioning the spindle higher up in the mount will produce less stresses in the z axis and gantry assemblies.",

My main pourpose would be for engraving anodized aluminum minimalist wallets, flasks and tumblers.\nI currently have an XTool D1. I was going to use it, but it takes it around 10 minutes to do a wallet and I want this time frame brought down. So, I am thinking a fiber may be the best choice....but I also want to keep it sub-$2000 if possible. It will be powered using a gas powered generator and will be in an enclosed area (meaining out of spectator viewing range - but still well ventilated).\nThoughts?",

    "text": "I bought this 3020 in Nov 2021 strictly for aluminum cutting. I‚Äôve been using a competitors machine for over a decade and it works great. I was disappointed with this machine and had several issues. It will cut aluminum but not not very well. The 1/8‚Äù bit must be all the way in the shaft. (And to prevent milling the table it‚Äôs best to lower the Z axis to the lowest point and raise the spindle in the holder so the bit can‚Äôt reach the table.) But the spindle is just not rigid enough to handle the cutting, the length of the shaft allows slight flexing. And the spindle doesn‚Äôt have enough speed or torque. I found that even slowly cutting a 1‚Äù hole in 2mm aluminum with 9 passes was nail biting. It did cut the hole but was a struggle. The finished hole was a few thousands under size because the spindle rigidity was causing it to flex inward. And just drilling a 1/8‚Äù hole w the milling bit would sputter when reaching the bottom, and wallowed the hole almost every time. So to fix both issues I hack sawed the spindle holder (another problem-only a 55mm spindle fits), and mounted a $70 rotozip (600W 30K RPM) with metal strapping. Now it mills, drills, and cuts much better. Note that after less than 10 hours the 300W spindle stopped working.\n\nThe other issue I had was that most all of the USB software I tried wouldn‚Äôt run a few commands of my existing gcode. Also, it was essential that I could stop and start the gcode from any gcode line, and couldn‚Äôt do it! So, to get around those problems I abandoned the USB controller and bought a parallel stepper driver and use LinuxCNC (or Mach2).\n\nOverall it‚Äôs a nice little machine but wouldn‚Äôt recommend for aluminum unless your into mods.",
