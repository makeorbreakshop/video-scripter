The only thing I am struggling on is that when I go to put the pieces that I cut out into the wood, there’s a tiny little gap. And I’m pretty sure that’s from the thickness of the laser cutting it. Do I just adjust the laser to be thinner or is there something I can do to counter this? I would like my inlays to look 100% Smooth and with no gaps. Please let me know what you think. Thanks",

Based on quotes for machines of the same size (1300mm), the OneLaser is about 24% more expensive than the Pronto, claims to be 20% faster, and offers the option of an RF laser. To my knowledge, neither machine uses servo motors like the Thunder Laser. It’s a very capable machine and may have better support than some competitors. However, it’s a new brand with no established track record, although it appears to be closely associated with Thunder Laser, which has a solid reputation. Definitely tempting.",

Even with shipping, it’s still super competitive compared to most professional lasers out there. What’s even better is that they’re planning to roll out extra features and lifetime upgrade options, which could turn this into the ultimate cabinet CO2 laser. It’s definitely shaping up to be a solid choice.\n\nOn the flip side, I’ve never used thunder machine but I had some experience with the OMTECH Pro series, and honestly, omtech services sucks, the speed didn’t match the advertised claims, and the bed would occasionally tilt, causing alignment issues and other issues here and there.—so I’m glad Onelaser stepping it up with a better game.\n\nWhat I really like about OneLaser is their U.S.-based team. They’re super responsive and actually take the time to answer questions properly, which you don’t see often. The only drawback? You’ve got to wait 2-3 months for inventory, but they’ve promised stock is on the way. Hopefully, they deliver on that soon!",
