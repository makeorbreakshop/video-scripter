# YouTube Channel Discovery Strategy - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary

### Vision
Implement a systematic, quota-efficient YouTube channel discovery system that expands our competitive intelligence database by leveraging subscription network effects and proven content patterns.

### Objectives
- Discover 50-100 new relevant channels per week
- Maintain <1% of daily API quota for discovery operations
- Achieve 95%+ relevance rate for discovered channels
- Scale to 1,000+ channels within 6 months

### Success Metrics
- **Discovery Rate**: 50-100 new channels/week
- **Quota Efficiency**: <100 units/day for discovery (1% of 10,000 daily quota)
- **Quality Score**: 95%+ relevance based on niche alignment
- **Network Coverage**: Map 80%+ of subscription relationships in target niches

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
- **Manual Discovery**: Time-intensive manual channel search and evaluation
- **Limited Scope**: Only discovering channels through basic keyword searches (100 units each)
- **Quality Issues**: High false positive rate from generic search results
- **Quota Waste**: Expensive search operations consume significant API budget

### Market Opportunity
- **Network Effects**: Leverage existing 100+ imported channels as discovery seeds
- **Proven Patterns**: Use clustering analysis insights for targeted discovery
- **Untapped Networks**: Access creator subscription networks for high-quality leads

## 3. Solution Overview

### Core Strategy: Multi-Method Network Discovery
Systematically discover channels through 8 complementary methods, leveraging existing network effects and community engagement patterns.

### 8-Method Discovery Pipeline
1. **Subscription Networks** (subscriptions.list) - Primary discovery method
2. **Featured Channels** (brandingSettings.channel.featuredChannelsUrls) - Curated recommendations
3. **Multi-Channel Shelves** (channelSections.list type="multipleChannels") - Collaborative content
4. **Playlist Creators** (playlistItems.list → videoOwnerChannelId) - Cross-creator content
5. **Comment Authors** (commentThreads.list → authorChannelId) - Engaged community members
6. **Strategic Search** (search.list for gap filling) - Targeted niche expansion
7. **Trending Analysis** (videos.list chart=mostPopular) - Emerging creators
8. **WebSub Push** (PubSubHubbub) - Zero-quota real-time monitoring

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1 Multi-Method Discovery Engine

#### Method 1: Subscription Network Crawler
- **API Integration**: YouTube Data API v3 `subscriptions.list` endpoint (1 unit + 1 unit/page)
- **Network Mapping**: Build graph of channel subscription relationships
- **Quota Usage**: ~0.3 units average per channel (most channels <50 subscriptions)

#### Method 2: Featured Channels Discovery  
- **API Integration**: `channels.list` → brandingSettings.channel.featuredChannelsUrls (included in existing calls)
- **Zero Additional Cost**: Extract from existing channel metadata calls
- **High Quality**: Manually curated by channel owners

#### Method 3: Multi-Channel Shelves
- **API Integration**: `channelSections.list` with type="multipleChannels" (1 unit)
- **Collaborative Content**: Channels grouped together by creators
- **Quality Indicator**: Intentional creator associations

#### Method 4: Playlist Creator Analysis
- **API Integration**: `playlistItems.list` → snippet.videoOwnerChannelId (1 unit)
- **Cross-Creator Discovery**: Find collaborating channels
- **Engagement Signal**: Channels featured in curated playlists

#### Method 5: Comment Author Mining
- **API Integration**: `commentThreads.list` → snippet.topLevelComment.snippet.authorChannelId (1 unit)
- **Community Engagement**: Active, engaged viewers who are also creators
- **Quality Filter**: Minimum comment quality and channel validation

#### Method 6: Strategic Search (Limited)
- **API Integration**: `search.list` with targeted queries (100 units)
- **Gap Filling**: Address underrepresented patterns from clustering analysis
- **Quota Limited**: Maximum 10 searches per week

#### Method 7: Trending Analysis
- **API Integration**: `videos.list` with chart=mostPopular by category (1 unit)
- **Emerging Creators**: Discover channels trending in relevant categories
- **Niche Jumping**: Expand beyond current network boundaries

#### Method 8: WebSub Real-Time Monitoring
- **PubSubHubbub**: Subscribe to channel feeds for real-time updates (0 units)
- **Cross-Reference**: Mine video descriptions and comments for channel mentions
- **Zero Cost**: Ongoing discovery without quota impact

#### Enhanced Data Model
```sql
CREATE TABLE channel_discovery (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    source_channel_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    discovered_channel_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    discovery_method TEXT NOT NULL, -- subscription, featured, shelf, playlist, comment, search, trending, websub
    subscriber_count INTEGER,
    video_count INTEGER,
    discovery_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    validation_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
    import_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
    relevance_score DECIMAL(3,2),
    discovery_context JSONB, -- method-specific metadata
    UNIQUE(source_channel_id, discovered_channel_id, discovery_method)
);

CREATE TABLE discovery_edges (
    source_channel_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    target_channel_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    edge_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- subscription, featured, shelf, playlist, comment
    discovered_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    PRIMARY KEY(source_channel_id, target_channel_id, edge_type)
);
```

#### Performance Requirements
- **Quota Usage**: ~4-6 units per channel fully processed (8 methods)
- **Daily Throughput**: 1,400+ channels per day at 10k quota (vs 1,180 with single method)
- **Processing Time**: <5 minutes per 100-channel batch
