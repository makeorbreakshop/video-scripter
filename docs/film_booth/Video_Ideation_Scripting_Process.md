# Film Booth Video Ideation & Scripting Process

## Overview
This document summarizes the Film Booth video ideation and scripting methodology, which focuses on creating YouTube videos that get views, build an audience, and drive business results. The process emphasizes research-driven content creation, pattern recognition, and systematic optimization.

## Core Principles

### BENS Framework
Every element of your video (title, thumbnail, script) should incorporate:
- **Big**: Bold, attention-grabbing claims that promise significant results
- **Easy**: Content feels effortless or achievable
- **New**: Fresh, unique, or surprising information
- **Safe**: Build trust and credibility through familiar elements

### Viewer Types
Target one primary viewer type:
1. **Casual Beginners**: Light, entertaining content with heavy storytelling
2. **Enthusiasts**: In-depth content with creative delivery and strong narratives
3. **Learners**: Clear, educational content that's easy to follow
4. **Experts**: Deep dives with advanced insights

## Phase 1: Research & Pattern Recognition

### Step 1: Build a Pattern Bank
1. **Create a Dummy YouTube Account**
   - Sign up with a new account for clean research
   - Watch 5 full videos from 3 creators in your niche
   - Like and subscribe to train the algorithm
   - Let YouTube recommend new channels and outliers

2. **Identify Outliers**
   - Small channels (<100K views/video): Look for videos with 3x+ average views
   - Large channels (>100K views/video): Look for videos with 2x+ average views
   - Use tools like 1of10 Chrome Extension to spot outliers

3. **Analyze 5-10 Competitor Channels**
   - Perform 12-month analysis on each channel
   - Log outlier titles, thumbnails, topics, and power words
   - Identify repeating patterns across successful videos

4. **Document Patterns**
   - Title structures and formulas
   - Common power words (e.g., "trick," "secret," "easy")
   - Thumbnail styles and elements
   - Popular topics and formats

### Step 2: Research Adjacent Niches
- Repeat the pattern analysis for 5 channels in related niches
- Look for crossover opportunities and fresh angles

## Phase 2: Ideation Process

### Step 3: Generate Video Ideas from Pattern Bank
1. **Create Titles (4 options per video)**
   - Copy exact outlier title structures
   - Combine two outlier titles
   - Add power words to existing patterns
   - Never use colons (:) in titles
   - Keep under 50 characters
   - Ensure BENS principles are present

2. **Design Thumbnail Concepts (3 doodles × 3 variations = 9 total)**
   - Thumbnail styles to choose from:
     - Cognitive Dissonance
     - Before/After Transformation
     - Result-Oriented
     - Social Hacking (familiar faces)
     - Curiosity-Driven
     - Minimalist/Cinematic

### Step 4: Validate Ideas
1. Upload thumbnails to thumbsup.tv for initial testing
2. Create vision board with outlier inspiration
3. Get feedback from community/team
4. Refine based on feedback
5. Create final 3 thumbnail versions for split testing

## Phase 3: Content Planning

### Step 5: Skyscraper Method Planning
1. **Find an Outlier on Your Topic**
   - Locate a high-performing video similar to your idea
   - Watch and note all points covered
   - Copy transcript and up to 200 top comments

2. **Analyze and Improve**
   - Identify what the outlier covered well
   - Find gaps or missing information
   - Plan to include original points + improvements
   - Add creative elements (stories, metaphors, visuals)

3. **Create Wireframe Plan**
   - List all points to cover in logical order
   - Place surprising/new information early
   - Plan examples and applications for each point
   - Structure: Intro → Points → End Screen

## Phase 4: Script Writing

### Step 6: Write Using the Brick System

**Intro Brick (15 seconds max)**
- Hook: Grab attention immediately
- Transition: Connect hook to main topic
- Setup: Promise what viewers will learn
- Credibility: Establish why they should trust you

**Middle Bricks (for each point)**
- Transition: Connect from previous point
- Example: Show through stories/metaphors/visuals
- Application: Give actionable steps

**End Brick**
- Transition: Signal the conclusion
- Poke New Problem: Create curiosity for next video
- CTA: Clear call-to-action

### Step 7: Script Writing Process
1. **First Draft (1-2 hours)**
   - Set timer and write to completion
   - Don't aim for perfection
   - Focus on getting all ideas down

2. **Edit and Refine**
   - Read aloud to catch awkward phrasing
   - Ensure setups create curiosity
   - Delay payoffs to maintain engagement
   - Check each point has clear value

3. **Get Feedback**
   - Use AI bots for intro and point refinement
   - Submit to team/community for review
   - Make final adjustments

## Phase 5: Production Preparation

### Step 8: Pre-Production Checklist
- Finalize script with clear delivery notes
- Prepare any visual aids or b-roll needs
- Create shot list if needed
- Batch film 3-4 videos for efficiency

## Key Success Metrics

### View Goals by Stage
- Starting: Aim for 1,000 views per video
- Growing: Target 3,000 views per video
- Established: Maintain 3,000+ views consistently

### Content Creation Rhythm
- Post 1 video per week minimum
- Produce in batches of 4 for efficiency
- Analyze performance data weekly
- Iterate based on what works

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Ideation Mistakes**
   - Using colons in titles (kills flow)
   - Titles over 50 characters
   - Ignoring BENS principles
   - Not researching outliers first

2. **Scripting Mistakes**
   - Intros longer than 15 seconds
   - Paying off curiosity too early
   - Not matching intro to thumbnail/title
   - Overcomplicating explanations

3. **Process Mistakes**
   - Perfectionism over consistency
   - Not batching video production
   - Ignoring pattern bank data
   - Skipping feedback loops

## Tools & Resources

- **Research**: 1of10 Chrome Extension, YouTube Analytics
- **Thumbnail Testing**: thumbsup.tv
- **AI Assistance**: Skyscraper Bot, Intro Bot, Point Bot
- **Planning**: Pattern Bank Spreadsheet, Wireframe Templates
- **Organization**: Vision boards, content calendars

## Summary

The Film Booth process transforms video creation from guesswork into a systematic, data-driven approach. By studying what works (outliers), recognizing patterns, and applying proven frameworks (BENS, Brick System), creators can consistently produce videos that attract viewers and build sustainable audiences.

Remember: Success comes from the cycle of Ready → Fire → Aim. Post consistently, analyze results, and iterate based on data rather than assumptions.
