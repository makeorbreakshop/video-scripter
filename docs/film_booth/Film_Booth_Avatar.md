## Content Discovery Strategy

### Understanding Avatar Content Patterns
When searching for Film Booth avatars, recognize they create diverse educational content to build authority and funnel viewers to their broader business offerings:

#### Common Content Types They Create
- **Pure skill teaching**: Technical tutorials, how-tos, demonstrations
- **Problem-solving content**: Fixing common mistakes, troubleshooting guides
- **Project walkthroughs**: Step-by-step builds, creations, processes
- **Tool/technique reviews**: Equipment demos, software tutorials
- **Business education**: How to make money, pricing strategies, client management
- **Industry insights**: Trends, analysis, professional tips

#### Their Business Model
These creators are sophisticated entrepreneurs who:
- Use YouTube as top-of-funnel for courses, coaching, services, products
- Build authority through consistent value delivery
- Monetize through multiple revenue streams beyond AdSense
- Create systematic content that serves specific business goals
- May teach business skills AND have their own course business

### Search Strategy for Finding Avatars

#### DON'T Search ONLY For:
- Business/money-making content (this misses skill-based educators)
- Viral/entertainment content (wrong avatar type)
- Hobby-only content (misses business-minded creators)

#### DO Search For BOTH:
**Skill-Based Searches:**
- "[Specific technique] tutorial"
- "How to [specific skill result]"
- "[Tool/material] basics for beginners"
- "[Problem] fix" or "[mistake] solution"

**Business-Teaching Searches:**
- "How to price [skill/service]"
- "[Industry] business tips"
- "Getting clients for [service]"
- "[Skill] passive income"

The key is casting a wider net - many Film Booth avatars teach pure skills, others teach business, and some do both. All are potential users of the tool.
