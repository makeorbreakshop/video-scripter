# Thumbnail Battle Game Architecture Documentation

**Last Updated**: August 22, 2025 at 1:55 PM PT  
**Status**: ✅ Fully Functional - Database-Based Implementation

## Overview
The Thumbnail Battle is a game where players are shown two YouTube video thumbnails from the same channel and must guess which one performed better (has a higher temporal performance score). This document describes the **current working implementation** as of August 22, 2025, including its architecture, data flow, and database-based storage system that replaced the previous broken in-memory approach.

## System Components

### 1. Frontend (Client-Side)
- **Location**: `/app/thumbnail-battle/page.tsx`
- **Technology**: Next.js App Router, React with hooks, Framer Motion for animations, Confetti.js for celebrations
- **State Management**: React useState with useCallback for optimized re-renders
- **Key Features**:
  - Pre-fetches and queues 5 matchups on load for instant gameplay
  - Background fetching when queue drops below 2 matchups
  - Local session management via localStorage with persistent session IDs
  - Speed-based scoring system (500-1000 points based on response time)
  - Live score countdown display showing current available points
  - Real-time timer with millisecond precision tracking
  - Responsive UI with keyboard shortcuts (A/B keys for selection)
  - Game state management: welcome → start → playing → revealed → gameOver
  - Lives system (3 lives, lose on wrong answer)

### 2. Backend API Endpoints

#### `/api/thumbnail-battle/get-matchup`
- **Purpose**: Generate a new matchup between two videos from the same channel
- **Method**: GET
- **Response Time**: ~204ms average
- **Process**:
  1. Queries Supabase for eligible channels with 10+ videos (> 30 days old, score > 0.1x)
  2. Filters channels by video count (minimum 10 videos per channel)
  3. Randomly selects a channel from eligible options
  4. Attempts high/low performer pairing (≥ 1.5x vs ≤ 0.8x scores) within 1 year timeframe
  5. Falls back to any two videos if no clear high/low split available
  6. Generates unique `matchup_id` using `crypto.randomUUID()`
  7. **DATABASE STORAGE**: Stores complete matchup data in `thumbnail_battle_matchups` table
  8. Formats subscriber counts as ballpark figures (rounds to nearest 100K/1M/etc)
  9. Returns videos WITHOUT temporal_performance_score (security measure)
- **Security**: Scores are stored server-side only until answer validation

#### `/api/thumbnail-battle/check-answer`
- **Purpose**: Validate player's selection and calculate points
- **Method**: POST
- **Body**: `{ matchup_id, selection, clicked_at, session_id }`
- **Process**:
  1. Validates required fields (matchup_id, selection)
  2. **DATABASE RETRIEVAL**: Queries `thumbnail_battle_matchups` table by matchup_id
  3. Checks matchup expiration (10-minute TTL from creation)
  4. Determines winner based on stored video scores (video_a_score vs video_b_score)
  5. Validates correctness (player selection matches actual winner)
  6. Calculates speed-based points:
     - ≤ 500ms: 1000 points (instant response)
     - ≥ 10s: 500 points (minimum)
     - 500ms-10s: Linear scale (1000 → 500 points)
     - Wrong answers: 0 points
  7. **ANALYTICS UPDATE**: Records player selection, correctness, response time, timestamp
  8. Returns result with scores revealed (videoA_score, videoB_score)

#### `/api/thumbnail-battle/player`
- **Purpose**: Manage player profiles and stats
- **Methods**:
  - GET: Retrieve player by session_id
  - POST: Create new player
  - PATCH: Update player stats (score, battles, wins)
- **Database**: `thumbnail_battle_players` table in Supabase

#### `/api/thumbnail-battle/leaderboard`
- **Purpose**: Fetch top players
- **Database**: Queries `thumbnail_battle_players` table
- **Types**: best_score, most_battles, today

#### `/api/thumbnail-battle/get-similar-matchup`
- **Purpose**: Alternative matchup generation using topic/format similarity
- **Note**: Currently not used by the main game

### 3. Storage Systems

#### Database (Supabase PostgreSQL) - Primary Storage

**Table**: `thumbnail_battle_matchups` *(New - Core Game Logic)*
- **Purpose**: Persistent storage for matchup data and player analytics
- **Schema**:
  - `id`: UUID primary key (auto-generated)
  - `matchup_id`: UUID unique identifier (sent to client)
  - `video_a_id`: TEXT foreign key to videos(id)
  - `video_b_id`: TEXT foreign key to videos(id)
  - `video_a_score`: DECIMAL(10,2) - temporal performance score
  - `video_b_score`: DECIMAL(10,2) - temporal performance score
  - `winner_id`: TEXT foreign key to videos(id)
  - `created_at`: TIMESTAMPTZ creation timestamp
  - `expires_at`: TIMESTAMPTZ (10-minute TTL)
  - `player_session_id`: TEXT (analytics)
  - `player_selection`: CHAR(1) - 'A' or 'B' (analytics)
  - `is_correct`: BOOLEAN (analytics)
  - `response_time_ms`: INTEGER (analytics)
  - `answered_at`: TIMESTAMPTZ (analytics)
- **Indexes**: matchup_id, expires_at, created_at, player_session_id
- **Cleanup**: `cleanup_expired_matchups()` function removes unanswered expired matchups

**Table**: `thumbnail_battle_players` *(Existing - Player Management)*
- **Purpose**: Player profiles and statistics
- **Schema**:
  - `id`: UUID primary key
  - `session_id`: TEXT unique session identifier
  - `player_name`: TEXT display name (max 30 chars)
  - `current_score`: INTEGER current game score
  - `best_score`: INTEGER all-time best score
  - `total_battles`: INTEGER number of matchups played
  - `total_wins`: INTEGER number of correct guesses
  - `attempts_today`: INTEGER daily play counter
  - `last_played`: TIMESTAMPTZ last activity
  - `created_at`: TIMESTAMPTZ account creation time

#### Removed Components
- **`/lib/thumbnail-battle-store.ts`**: ❌ Deleted - In-memory storage was incompatible with Next.js API routes
- **In-Memory Map**: ❌ Removed - Caused 404 errors due to memory isolation between API routes

## Data Flow (Current Working Implementation)

### Game Initialization
```
1. Page Load
   ↓
2. Initialize sessionId from localStorage (persistent across sessions)
   ↓
3. loadInitialBattles() → Fetch 5 matchups concurrently
   ↓
4. Each matchup:
   a. GET /api/thumbnail-battle/get-matchup generates unique matchup
   b. INSERT into thumbnail_battle_matchups table with:
      - matchup_id (UUID)
      - video_a_id, video_b_id, scores, winner_id
      - expires_at (created_at + 10 minutes)
   c. Returns matchup WITHOUT scores to client (security)
   ↓
5. First matchup → battle state (gameState = 'start')
   Remaining 4 → battleQueue array
   ↓
6. Background image preloading for all queued matchups
```

### Playing a Round
```
1. Player sees two thumbnails (gameState = 'playing')
   ↓
2. Timer starts (roundStartTime = Date.now()) - triggers useEffect
   ↓
3. Live score countdown shows decreasing points (1000 → 500)
   ↓
4. Player clicks thumbnail A or B (or uses A/B keyboard shortcuts)
   ↓
5. handleSelection() sends POST to check-answer endpoint:
   - matchup_id (from current battle.matchup_id)
   - selection ('A' or 'B')
   - clicked_at (elapsed milliseconds since roundStartTime)
   - session_id (for analytics tracking)
   ↓
6. check-answer endpoint:
   a. SELECT from thumbnail_battle_matchups WHERE matchup_id = ?
   b. ✅ SUCCESS: Retrieves stored matchup data
   c. Validates expiration (< 10 minutes old)
   d. Determines winner (video_a_score vs video_b_score)
   e. Calculates points based on response time
   f. UPDATE matchup record with player analytics
   g. Returns result with scores revealed
   ↓
7. Client receives response (gameState = 'revealed'):
   - Updates score if correct
   - Shows winner/loser with performance multipliers
   - Triggers confetti animation if correct
   - Updates player stats in database
   ↓
8. "Next" button advances to next queued matchup
```

### Queue Management
```
Queue Status → Action
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
> 2 matchups → Use next from queue
≤ 2 matchups → Trigger background fetch of 3 more
0 matchups   → Synchronous fetch (with loading state)
```

## Database-Based Solution (Current Implementation)

### Why It Works
The system now uses **persistent database storage** to store matchup data between the `get-matchup` and `check-answer` API calls:

1. **Persistent Storage**: Database survives server restarts and API route isolation
2. **Scalable**: Multiple concurrent users supported with proper indexing
3. **Analytics-Ready**: Rich data collection for reporting and insights
4. **Production-Safe**: Works identically in development and production environments

### Architecture Flow
```
get-matchup endpoint:          check-answer endpoint:
┌─────────────────────┐        ┌─────────────────────┐
│                     │        │                     │
│  INSERT INTO        │        │  SELECT FROM        │
│  thumbnail_battle_  │        │  thumbnail_battle_  │
│  matchups           │        │  matchups           │
│                     │        │                     │
└─────────────────────┘        └─────────────────────┘
         ↓                              ↓
   Stores in database           Retrieves from database
                                Returns result → ✅ SUCCESS
```

### Current User Experience
- ✅ Timer and UI work perfectly
- ✅ Thumbnails display and load quickly
- ✅ Clicking triggers proper animation and validation
- ✅ All answers are validated correctly (no 404 errors)
- ✅ Points calculated accurately based on response speed
- ✅ Scores persist and leaderboards update
- ✅ Rich analytics data collected for each interaction

## Performance Optimizations in Current Design

### Pre-fetching Strategy
- 5 matchups loaded before game starts
- No waiting between rounds (instant from queue)
- Background refill maintains 2+ matchup buffer
- Image preloading via `new Image()` for all queued matchups

### Speed Scoring Algorithm
```javascript
if (elapsed <= 500ms)        → 1000 points (superhuman!)
if (elapsed >= 10000ms)      → 500 points (minimum)
else → Linear interpolation   → 500-1000 points
```

### Security Model (Current Implementation)
The system implements a robust security model:
1. ✅ **Server-Side Validation**: Scores never sent to client until after answer submission
2. ✅ **Database Storage**: Answers stored securely server-side only
3. ✅ **Unique Matchup IDs**: Prevents replay attacks and answer manipulation
4. ✅ **Expiration TTL**: 10-minute expiry prevents stale data and reduces storage
5. ✅ **Input Validation**: All API endpoints validate required fields and data types
6. ✅ **No Client Tampering**: Performance scores impossible to manipulate via DevTools

## Analytics & Data Collection

### Player Performance Metrics
The system collects comprehensive analytics for each interaction:
- **Response Times**: Millisecond precision for speed analysis
- **Accuracy Tracking**: Win/loss ratios per session and overall
- **Session Persistence**: Player data survives browser restarts
- **Temporal Analysis**: Performance trends over time
- **Channel Performance**: Which channels/videos are hardest to predict

### Current Data Volume (as of August 22, 2025)
- **Total Matchups Created**: 60
- **Player Answers Recorded**: 21
- **Active Player Sessions**: 3
- **Average Response Time**: 2.0-6.2 seconds per player
- **Accuracy Range**: 33.3% - 100% depending on player skill

### Available Queries for Analysis
```sql
-- Player performance comparison
SELECT session_id, 
       COUNT(*) as battles,
       AVG(response_time_ms) as avg_speed,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN is_correct THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as accuracy
FROM thumbnail_battle_matchups 
WHERE player_selection IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY session_id;

-- Channel difficulty analysis
SELECT v.channel_title,
       COUNT(*) as total_battles,
       AVG(CASE WHEN is_correct THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END) as avg_accuracy
FROM thumbnail_battle_matchups m
JOIN videos v ON v.id = m.video_a_id
WHERE m.is_correct IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY v.channel_title;
```
