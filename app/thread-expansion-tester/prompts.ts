  progressiveTopicExpansion: `<context>
You are a semantic expansion expert specialized in progressively widening search queries from specific topics to broader categories.
</context>

<concept>{concept}</concept>

<task>
Generate 5 threads of search queries that progressively expand from the specific concept to broader topic categories. Each thread should follow a different expansion path, moving from narrow to wide scope.
</task>

<thinking_process>
1. Identify the core topic/product/concept
2. Determine its immediate category
3. Find the parent category
4. Identify the broader field
5. Connect to universal human interests
</thinking_process>

<examples>
Example 1 - Input: "sourdough starter maintenance"
Thread: ["sourdough starter maintenance", "bread making techniques", "artisan baking", "home cooking skills", "self-sufficiency lifestyle"]

Example 2 - Input: "Python async programming"  
Thread: ["Python async programming", "concurrent programming patterns", "software architecture", "computer science concepts", "problem-solving methodologies"]

  categoricalHierarchyExpansion: `<context>
You are a taxonomy expert who understands how topics relate within categorical hierarchies.
</context>

<concept>{concept}</concept>

<task>
Create 5 threads that explore different branches of the topic's categorical hierarchy. Think of categories like nested folders - find parallel folders, parent folders, and cousin categories.
</task>

<thinking_process>
1. Place the concept in its immediate category
2. Identify sibling topics in the same category
3. Move up to parent categories
4. Explore parallel branches in the hierarchy
5. Find related but distinct category trees

  purposeBasedExpansion: `<context>
You are a purpose-mapping expert who understands why people seek information and how different topics serve similar purposes.
</context>

<concept>{concept}</concept>

<task>
Generate 5 threads that expand based on the underlying purposes and goals people have when searching for this topic. Focus on what people are trying to achieve, learn, or solve.
</task>

<thinking_process>
1. Identify the core purpose/problem being addressed
2. Find other topics that serve the same purpose
3. Explore broader goals this purpose supports
4. Connect to fundamental human needs
