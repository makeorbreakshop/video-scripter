## Key Insights:

### 1. **Format Differences**:
- Beginner content heavily favors listicles (87% vs 60%)
- Advanced content has more tutorials proportionally (30% vs 10%)
- Both use listicles but with different framing

- **Beginners**: Quantity ("20+ projects"), simplicity, accessibility
- **Advanced**: Quality, skills, professional techniques
- **Beginners**: Project-outcome focused
- **Advanced**: Skill-acquisition focused

### 3. **Performance Patterns**:
- **Beginner videos** show higher performance ratios (overperforming baseline)
- **Advanced videos** perform closer to channel baselines
- Suggests beginner content has broader appeal/search volume

### 4. **Semantic Differences**:
- **Beginner keywords**: easy, simple, budget, mini, small, scrap
- **Advanced keywords**: mastery, essential, superior, accuracy, efficiency, CNC

### 5. **Channel Ecosystem**:
- Beginner space dominated by general DIY/craft channels
- Advanced space features specialized woodworking professionals
- Different creator economics and audience expectations

## Conclusion:
Patterns DO change significantly based on semantic location. The same topic area (woodworking) shows distinct content strategies, performance characteristics, and creator ecosystems depending on the skill level being targeted. This validates the hypothesis that semantic neighborhoods have their own "physics" for what works.
